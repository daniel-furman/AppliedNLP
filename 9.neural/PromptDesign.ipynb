While GPT-2 is a less expressive model than GPT-3 (and hence not as a good of a few shot learner), it can fit within the memory and processing constraints of laptops while also being openly available.  Can you create a new classification task and design prompts to differentiate between the classes within it?"

You are free to consider binary classification or multiclass classifaction; keep in mind that you have ~1000 tokens to use as a prompt for GPT-2, so be sure to provide enough answered prompts for each class.  (Note it is not a requirement that your model performs *well* (we want to assess what is -- and isn't -- learnable) but give it every opportunity to do so.  Create 5 test examples to assess whether GPT-2 is able to recognize the class given your fixed prompt.  To take the language ID task above, one test example corresponds to one prediction you make for the same set of answered prompts; the following constitutes two test examples for that task:\n",
