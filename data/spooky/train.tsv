EAP	They partook less of transport and more of calm enthusiasm of enthusiastic repose.
EAP	"To return was out of the question, and no time was to be lost, as their pursuers were close upon their heels."

EAP	"Having reached the door, however, of the burgomaster's dwelling, the professor ventured to suggest that as the messenger had thought proper to disappear no doubt frightened to death by the savage appearance of the burghers of Rotterdam the pardon would be of little use, as no one but a man of the moon would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance."
EAP	"I should mention, too, that this limb was no farther subject to my will."
EAP	"No path was trodden in its vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there was need of putting back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of forest trees, and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant flowers."

EAP	"I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings."
EAP	"The balloon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man, hurled me with great force over the rim of the car, and left me dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of the wicker work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most providentially entangled."

EAP	"She was a very beautiful and painfully modest young lady, who thought the ordinary mode of habiliment indecent, and wished to dress herself, always, by getting outside instead of inside of her clothes."

EAP	"M. Beauvais, not being an idiot, could never have urged, in identification of the corpse, simply hair upon its arm."
EAP	Spoke quick and unevenly.
EAP	"I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit's end than myself; my rival had a weakness in the faucal or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper."

EAP	And the flames of the tripods expired.
EAP	"Here was art undoubtedly that did not surprise me all roads, in the ordinary sense, are works of art; nor can I say that there was much to wonder at in the mere excess of art manifested; all that seemed to have been done, might have been done here with such natural ""capabilities"" as they have it in the books on Landscape Gardening with very little labor and expense."
EAP	"I practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented marsh; herein, however, having no reference to a similar proceeding of Demosthenes, but from a design peculiarly and conscientiously my own."
EAP	"You alone, habited in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about me."

EAP	"Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements."
EAP	"The diddler purchases one or two dozen of these blanks, and every day dips one of them in his soup, makes his dog jump for it, and finally gives it to him as a bonne bouche."

EAP	"I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us, still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth."
EAP	"These works I cut up thoroughly with a currycomb, and then, throwing the shreds into a sieve, sifted out carefully all that might be thought decent, a mere trifle; reserving the hard phrases, which I threw into a large tin pepper castor with longitudinal holes, so that an entire sentence could get through without material injury."

HPL	"Again I shivered, for I did not like the things that the night had brought, and wished bitterly that no forefather had summoned me to this primal rite."
HPL	Thank heaven these creatures employed no dogs for tracking though perhaps that would have been impossible amidst the omnipresent regional odour.
HPL	"Dr. Johnson was second to no Man in the Pains he took to revise the bad Verses of others; indeed, 'tis said that in the book of poor blind old Mrs. Williams, there are scarce two lines which are not the Doctor's."
HPL	"""May ne'er a noble of thy murd'rous line Survive to reach a greater age than thine"" spake he, when, suddenly leaping backwards into the black wood, he drew from his tunic a phial of colourless liquid which he threw into the face of his father's slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the night."

HPL	"Almost eight feet tall, and carrying a cheap new valise from Osborn's general store, this dark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in Arkham in quest of the dreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college library the hideous Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred in Olaus Wormius' Latin version, as printed in Spain in the seventeenth century."
HPL	"In the chaos of sliding, shifting earth I clawed and floundered helplessly till the rain on my head steadied me and I saw that I had come to the surface in a familiar spot; a steep unforested place on the southwest slope of the mountain."
HPL	"In the place of conical hats and muskets there were three cornered hats and small swords, and lace and snowy periwigs."
HPL	"Now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped."

HPL	"One of a large herd of unkempt Mexicans attracted thither from the neighbouring country, he at first commanded attention only because of his features; which though plainly of the Red Indian type, were yet remarkable for their light colour and refined conformation, being vastly unlike those of the average ""Greaser"" or Piute of the locality."
HPL	"The two particulars in question are these: the arms on the golden locket about the creature's neck were the Jermyn arms, and the jocose suggestion of M. Verhaeren about a certain resemblance as connected with the shrivelled face applied with vivid, ghastly, and unnatural horror to none other than the sensitive Arthur Jermyn, great great great grandson of Sir Wade Jermyn and an unknown wife."
HPL	Thou shalt shew me the ways of travel and I will attend thy songs at evening when the stars one by one bring dreams to the minds of dreamers.

HPL	"It was long ere any traveller went thither, and even then only the brave and adventurous young men of distant Falona dared make the journey; adventurous young men of yellow hair and blue eyes, who are no kin to the men of Mnar."
HPL	"The scenery, judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists."
HPL	Then there was another our first whose exact fate we had never learned.

HPL	"Then he began once more the writing of books, which he had left off when dreams first failed him."
HPL	"And he gazed also upon Mount Aran rising regally from the shore, its lower slopes green with swaying trees and its white summit touching the sky."

HPL	Whether the events of that night were of reality or illusion I shall never ascertain.
HPL	Briden pushed at the stone in several places without result.

HPL	"The pale enthusiast now applied some last perfunctory tests for absolute lifelessness, withdrew satisfied, and finally injected into the left arm an accurately measured amount of the vital elixir, prepared during the afternoon with a greater care than we had used since college days, when our feats were new and groping."

HPL	"All at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular object on the opposite slope, which rose steeply about an hundred yards ahead of me; an object that gleamed whitely in the newly bestowed rays of the ascending moon."

HPL	It was in the dark of September th that the horror broke loose.
HPL	"But now, at last, he had not only found an accessible copy but had made it his own at a ludicrously low figure."

HPL	"When Tillinghast said these things I remonstrated, for I knew him well enough to be frightened rather than amused; but he was a fanatic, and drove me from the house."

HPL	"My room, a dismal rear one with two windows and bare, cheap furnishings, overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low, deserted brick blocks, and commanded a view of decrepit westward stretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond."

HPL	"But before his resolution was put to the test, the unexpected intervened."
HPL	"Harsh but impressive polysyllables had replaced the customary mixture of bad Spanish and worse English, and of these only the oft repeated cry ""Huitzilopotchli"" seemed in the least familiar."
HPL	"There had been servants Ann White especially who would not use the cellar kitchen, and at least three well defined legends bore upon the queer quasi human or diabolic outlines assumed by tree roots and patches of mould in that region."
HPL	"In a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre's extent, clear of trees and tolerably dry."

HPL	"Inertia and force of habit, however, caused him to defer action; and he lingered indecisively among thoughts of old times, taking down the strange hangings from his walls and refitting the house as it was in his early boyhood purple panes, Victorian furniture, and all."
HPL	"In the end, though, luck favoured us; for one day we heard of an almost ideal case in the potter's field; a brawny young workman drowned only the morning before in Sumner's Pond, and buried at the town's expense without delay or embalming."

HPL	"Then, as more men came to the growing cluster of houses and looked about for places to dwell, they built cabins along the north side; cabins of stout oaken logs with masonry on the side toward the forest, for many Indians lurked there with fire arrows."
HPL	They imply that I am a madman or a murderer probably I am mad.

HPL	"Henry Wheeler, trembling, turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see what he might."
HPL	"Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create."

HPL	"they never stopped swimmin' in an' aout o' the river from that cursed reef o' Satan an' more an' more attic winders got a boarded up, an' more an' more noises was heerd in haouses as wa'n't s'posed to hev nobody in 'em. . . ."

HPL	"Holding with Haeckel that all life is a chemical and physical process, and that the so called ""soul"" is a myth, my friend believed that artificial reanimation of the dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues; and that unless actual decomposition has set in, a corpse fully equipped with organs may with suitable measures be set going again in the peculiar fashion known as life."

HPL	"It was plain that Manton knew more than I, but he told nothing to the puzzled and interested physicians till he had learned what our injuries were."
HPL	"I do so because of my desire to set certain unusual facts before the public; a thing I shall not in all probability survive to accomplish in person, since the circumstances surrounding me are as menacing as they are extraordinary, and involve not only the hopeless crippling of the U , but the impairment of my iron German will in a manner most disastrous."
HPL	"But mind ye, Luther he didn't see nothin' at all, only just the bendin' trees an' underbrush."
HPL	"The Sefton tragedy they will not connect with West; not that, nor the men with the box, whose existence they deny."

HPL	"It was alive now, and early villagers courtesied as the horsemen clattered down the street and turned off into the lane that ends in the abyss of dream."
HPL	"Still, he was very old and very feeble, and there were two visitors."

HPL	"I heard them in my youth from the lips of a playmate, a beggar's boy given to strange dreams, who would weave long tales about the moon and the flowers and the west wind."
HPL	"Something about them seemed so odd and provocative that I could not put them out of my mind, and despite the relative lateness of the hour I resolved to see the local sample said to be a large, queerly proportioned thing evidently meant for a tiara if it could possibly be arranged."

HPL	"So, climbing out of the window and down the improvised rope ladder, I left behind me forever the morbid and horror infested fabric of the Gilman House."
HPL	"They were as furtive and seldom seen as animals that live in burrows, and one could hardly imagine how they passed the time apart from their desultory fishing."
HPL	"No it wasn't the paintings I saw in that place; though I'll swear they were enough to get him ostracised in nine tenths of the homes and clubs of Boston, and I guess you won't wonder now why I have to steer clear of subways and cellars."
HPL	In the evening Barry dined with me and announced that he would begin the drainage in two days.
HPL	"What Roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in half human flesh and blood?"""
HPL	She certainly knew nothing about it.
HPL	"Kuranes was now very anxious to return to minaret studded Celephaïs, and increased his doses of drugs; but eventually he had no more money left, and could buy no drugs."
HPL	"He was puzzled by one thing, a peak of solid matter, protruding above the ocean bed nearly four feet at its apex; about two feet thick, with flat sides and smooth upper surfaces which met at a very obtuse angle."
HPL	Even now They talked in Their tombs.
HPL	"God, man Don't you realise that places like that weren't merely made, but actually grew?"
HPL	"After each short and inevitable sleep I seemed older, whilst my friend aged with a rapidity almost shocking."
HPL	"The Kanakys told 'em as haow folks from the other islands might wanta wipe 'em aout ef they got wind o' their bein' thar, but they says they dun't keer much, because they cud wipe aout the hull brood o' humans ef they was willin' to bother that is, any as didn't hev sarten signs sech as was used onct by the lost Old Ones, whoever they was."
HPL	"His screams had reached the house, and I had hastened to the terrible scene in time to hear a whir of wings and see a vague black cloudy thing silhouetted against the rising moon."
HPL	"Dances in the modern cemeteries were freely pictured, and another conception somehow shocked me more than all the rest a scene in an unknown vault, where scores of the beasts crowded about one who held a well known Boston guide book and was evidently reading aloud."
HPL	"When he and I obtained our degrees at the medical school of Miskatonic University, and sought to relieve our poverty by setting up as general practitioners, we took great care not to say that we chose our house because it was fairly well isolated, and as near as possible to the potter's field."
HPL	"No one dared do anything, and no one knew till morning whence the call came."
HPL	"We've had enough of the other stuff, but I for one need something."
HPL	"His madness, or at least his partial perversion, seemed beyond dispute."
HPL	"Then, amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror."
HPL	The predatory excursions on which we collected our unmentionable treasures were always artistically memorable events.
HPL	"A sense of duty to science is all that impels me to recall, in these last years of my life, scenes and happenings fraught with a terror doubly acute because I cannot wholly define it."
HPL	"They suspected that I was holding something back, and perhaps suspected graver things; but I could not tell them the truth because they would not have believed it."
HPL	"Having strown it with fir boughs, all now rested on it with drawn automatics, two relaxing while the third watched."
HPL	"It was more horrible than anything I had ever overheard, because I could now see the expression of his face, and could realise that this time the motive was stark fear."
HPL	"I won't say that all this is wholly true in body, but 'tis sufficient true to furnish a very pretty spectacle now and then."
HPL	"Probably it was his work which put the idea into my head, and anyhow, I found him a mine of data and suggestions when I came to develop it."
HPL	In reply to my question Tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was not electrical in any sense that I could understand.
HPL	So the boy whom the dark people called Menes smiled more often than he wept as he sate playing with his graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagon.
HPL	"More than ever Kuranes wished to sail in a galley to the far places of which he had heard so many strange tales, and he sought again the captain who had agreed to carry him so long ago."
HPL	The terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous confirmation of the mountaineers' wildest legends.
HPL	"It was a long dog trot to the ruined station, and the great brick warehouse walls around me seemed somehow more terrifying than the fronts of private houses."
HPL	"Now thoroughly disgusted with my host, I ordered him to release me, and told him I would go at once."
HPL	I should think you'd have known I didn't drop Pickman for the same silly reasons that fussy old women like Dr. Reid or Joe Minot or Bosworth did.
HPL	"It was good theory, but couldn't keep up indefinitely."
HPL	My reason for going ahead to Babson was that I wished neither to re cross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as South.
HPL	Of the original workmanship of this titanic thing I can only make conjectures.
HPL	By the middle of October we were puzzled by our lack of progress.
HPL	"Armitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction indicated; and most of the natives followed slowly."
HPL	Armitage chose his words very carefully.
HPL	That it could not come from any known myth or romance was made especially clear by the fact that the unfortunate lunatic expressed himself only in his own simple manner.
HPL	"Old Bugs, springing up from the crouching position in which he had hitherto been, leaped at the youth and dashed from his hands the uplifted glass, almost simultaneously attacking the tray of bottles and glasses with his mop, and scattering the contents upon the floor in a confusion of odoriferous fluid and broken bottles and tumblers."
HPL	"It was not a pleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and startled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood out with more than natural clearness and reality."
HPL	"It was I who fled frantically out of Innsmouth in the early morning hours of July , , and whose frightened appeals for government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported episode."
HPL	"Henceforward I haunted the tomb each night; seeing, hearing, and doing things I must never reveal."
HPL	"Average people in society and business New England's traditional ""salt of the earth"" gave an almost completely negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions appear here and there, always between March d and April nd the period of young Wilcox's delirium."
HPL	"With his fanciful mind he thought often of the prehistoric civilisation in which the mad explorer had so implicitly believed, and would weave tale after tale about the silent jungle city mentioned in the latter's wilder notes and paragraphs."
HPL	"I think, on the whole, that it was this variety which chiefly disturbed me."
HPL	"He raved of things he did not understand and could not interpret; things which he claimed to have experienced, but which he could not have learned through any normal or connected narration."
HPL	Meanwhile no more must be told.
HPL	"I seemed to know where I was, but cannot recall what I then knew."
HPL	"He had not known until our hallway conversation that I could overhear his playing in my room, and now asked me if I would arrange with Blandot to take a lower room where I could not hear him in the night."
HPL	"The practices I heard attributed to him would be unbelievable today, at least in a city; and even Peck Valley would have shuddered a bit had it known the easy ethics of its mortuary artist in such debatable matters as the ownership of costly ""laying out"" apparel invisible beneath the casket's lid, and the degree of dignity to be maintained in posing and adapting the unseen members of lifeless tenants to containers not always calculated with sublimest accuracy."
HPL	"The curtains, still clutched in his right hand as his left clawed out at me, grew taut and finally crashed down from their lofty fastenings; admitting to the room a flood of that full moonlight which the brightening of the sky had presaged."
HPL	"The change in the quality of the daylight increased, and the crowd gazed about the horizon in wonder."
HPL	"Gilman's handling of this theme filled everyone with admiration, even though some of his hypothetical illustrations caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous and solitary eccentricity."
HPL	"As I surveyed this quaint apartment, I felt an increase in that aversion first excited by the bleak exterior of the house."
HPL	"The final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet, giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used."
HPL	"Horrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my best friend, Crawford Tillinghast."
HPL	All that I recalled of a classic youth came to my lips as the horrors of the situation roused my deepest superstitions.
HPL	He ees too seeck for doctair heemself seecker and seecker all the time but he weel not have no othair for help.
HPL	"For some unknown reason I dreaded the thought of disturbing the ancient bog and its sunless secrets, and pictured terrible sights lying black under the unmeasured depth of age old peat."
HPL	"A few more thoughts were exchanged, and I knew that the luminous one and I were being recalled to bondage, though for my brother of light it would be the last time."
HPL	"There is talk of apportioning Randolph Carter's estate among his heirs, but I shall stand firmly against this course because I do not believe he is dead."
HPL	"May heaven forgive the folly and morbidity which led us both to so monstrous a fate Wearied with the commonplaces of a prosaic world, where even the joys of romance and adventure soon grow stale, St. John and I had followed enthusiastically every aesthetic and intellectual movement which promised respite from our devastating ennui."
HPL	A moment later came the titanic thunderbolt of thunderbolts; blasting that accursed house of unutterable secrets and bringing the oblivion which alone saved my mind.
HPL	"The stuffed goddess was a nauseous sight, withered and eaten away, but it was clearly a mummified white ape of some unknown species, less hairy than any recorded variety, and infinitely nearer mankind quite shockingly so."
HPL	"His new novels were successful as his old ones had never been; and because he knew how empty they must be to please an empty herd, he burned them and ceased his writing."
HPL	It was he who had given me all the information I had of Tillinghast after I was repulsed in rage.
HPL	So far I had seen none of the lower animals in Innsmouth.
HPL	What it shewed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on that awful canvas.
HPL	"And frightened as I was, I yet retained enough of perception to note that his speech, when articulate, was not of any sort known to me."
HPL	"His own view, postulating simply a building and location of markedly unsanitary qualities, had nothing to do with abnormality; but he realised that the very picturesqueness which aroused his own interest would in a boy's fanciful mind take on all manner of gruesome imaginative associations."
HPL	"For out of an opened door in the Gilman House a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouring lanterns bobbing in the darkness, and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not English."
HPL	On the third morning occurred the first of the man's mental attacks.
HPL	Still I was at a loss to gather the purport of his disconnected speech.
HPL	"Then he knew he must go into the past and merge himself with old things, and day after day he thought of the hills to the north where haunted Arkham and the rushing Miskatonic and the lonely rustic homestead of his people lay."
HPL	"As we descended the shaft, the sound beneath grew definitely composite."
HPL	"It was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and caused the Boston Globe and Arkham Advertiser to print flamboyant Sunday stories of young Wilbur's precociousness, Old Whateley's black magic, the shelves of strange books, the sealed second story of the ancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises."
HPL	"We also denied the request of a delegation headed by Seaman Zimmer, that the curious carved ivory head be cast into the sea."
HPL	"As the weeks passed, I observed with regret that my new friend was indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically, as Mrs. Herrero had suggested."
HPL	And upward along that pallid path my fevered fancy pictured a thin shadow slowly writhing; a vague contorted shadow struggling as if drawn by unseen daemons.
HPL	"Just then, however, chance made the opening which my questions had been unable to make; and the wheezing ancient's rambling took a turn that caused me to lean forward and listen alertly."
HPL	"He knew but a few words of English, while I found my Oxonian Spanish was something quite different from the patois of the peon of New Spain."
HPL	"There are things about which it is better not to speculate, and all that I can say is that I hate the smell of ammonia, and grow faint at a draught of unusually cool air."
HPL	"Then we split up into narrow columns, each of which seemed drawn in a different direction."
HPL	"And as if sharpened by the coming deprivation of light, my desire to explore the watery secrets grew."
HPL	"Nex' day Obed an' thutty two others was in gaol, with everbody a wonderin' jest what was afoot an' jest what charge agin' 'em cud be got to holt."
HPL	"I do not recall distinctly when it began, but it was months ago."
HPL	"It was a faith of which other Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made."
HPL	"Then came a period when luck was poor; interments fell off, and those that did occur were of specimens either too diseased or too maimed for use."
HPL	"The Whateleys had received their visitors with ill concealed distaste, though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk."
HPL	"After that I recall running, spade in hand; a hideous run across moon litten, mound marked meadows and through diseased, precipitous abysses of haunted hillside forest; leaping, screaming, panting, bounding toward the terrible Martense mansion."
HPL	"And among the dead faces was the living, mocking face of the youth with the ivory image."
HPL	"And pox on him, I'm afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rum whether or not by intent for a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it."
HPL	"Klenze had gone mad and perished before reaching this sinister remnant of a past unwholesomely remote, and had advised me to go with him."
HPL	"Especially were we apprehensive concerning the mind and impulses of the creature, since in the space following death some of the more delicate cerebral cells might well have suffered deterioration."
HPL	"Yet through the dark natures of the father and the son ran one redeeming ray of humanity; the evil old man loved his offspring with fierce intensity, whilst the youth had for his parent a more than filial affection."
HPL	"Innsmouth itself was left almost depopulated, and is even now only beginning to shew signs of a sluggishly revived existence."
HPL	"Twice a year they would light fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence; while at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely farmhouse."
HPL	"Physicians found no adequate cause for the end, and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitution."
HPL	"I cannot express the wild, breathless suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimen the first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech, perhaps to tell of what it had seen beyond the unfathomable abyss."
HPL	You are not as badly off as you might be but you must get out of here at once and stay away.
HPL	"Now he must be well over a hundred, but that piping voice could come from no one else."
HPL	"In the coffin lay an amulet of curious and exotic design, which had apparently been worn around the sleeper's neck."
HPL	"The man was great I say it even now, knowing as much as I do."
HPL	One of the three it is not certain which shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs.
HPL	He's supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight.
HPL	"Hidden behind heavy curtains stood the two unfinished figures of Tyché, little touched of late by the sick man and his faithful attendant."
HPL	"He was ready, I think, to see proof of his increasingly strong opinion that consciousness, reason, and personality can exist independently of the brain that man has no central connective spirit, but is merely a machine of nervous matter, each section more or less complete in itself."
HPL	"In , when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic University called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and three quarters feet tall."
HPL	"I did not tell very much of what I had seen, for I feared the coroner would be sceptical; but from the evasive outline I did give, the doctor told me that I had undoubtedly been hypnotised by the vindictive and homicidal madman."
HPL	"It was partly human, beyond a doubt, with very man like hands and head, and the goatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateleys upon it."
HPL	"Over the door, however, the high, slit like transom in the brick facade gave promise of possible enlargement to a diligent worker; hence upon this his eyes long rested as he racked his brains for means to reach it."
HPL	"No word was uttered, for the spot and the task seemed known to us; and without delay we seized our spades and commenced to clear away the grass, weeds, and drifted earth from the flat, archaic mortuary."
HPL	"Nearly mad, I found myself yet able to throw out a hand to ward off the foetid apparition which pressed so close; when in one cataclysmic second of cosmic nightmarishness and hellish accident my fingers touched the rotting outstretched paw of the monster beneath the golden arch."
HPL	"After a time I seemed to hear the stairs and corridors creak at intervals as if with footsteps, and wondered if the other rooms were beginning to fill up."
HPL	"To hear him discussing ways and means was rather ghastly, for at the college we had never procured anatomical specimens ourselves."
HPL	"The doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man."
HPL	"In my donations I was careful not to overshoot the mark, for I did not wish Zadok's vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor."
HPL	This I learned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first brought the region to the world's notice.
HPL	"About he removed to Constantinopolis, where he received every mark of imperial favour both from Justinianus and Justinus the Second."
HPL	"The bleak mountain wind, sighing through the olive grove and the tomb tree, had an uncanny way of forming vaguely articulate sounds."
HPL	"And thereafter the ocean told me its secrets no more; and though many times since has the moon shone full and high in the heavens, the White Ship from the South came never again."
HPL	"""Great God, what simpletons Shew them Arthur Machen's Great God Pan and they'll think it a common Dunwich scandal But what thing what cursed shapeless influence on or off this three dimensioned earth was Wilbur Whateley's father?"
HPL	"Heh, heh Nobody never believes me naow when I tell 'em, an' I dun't s'pose you will, young feller though come to look at ye, ye hev kind o' got them sharp readin' eyes like Obed had."""
HPL	"Messrs. Ricci and Silva were experienced in the art of making unwilling persons voluble, and the screams of a weak and exceptionally venerable man can be easily muffled."
HPL	The box held only a queer parchment whose characters no linguist or palaeographer has been able to decipher or identify.
HPL	"Whilst I had hitherto considered this but a natural attribute of a family of short lived men, I afterward pondered long upon these premature deaths, and began to connect them with the wanderings of the old man, who often spoke of a curse which for centuries had prevented the lives of the holders of my title from much exceeding the span of thirty two years."
HPL	"His flesh, though dry and firm, was of the quality of ice; and I almost shrank away from his pulling."
HPL	"There was not much, though, that he could say."
HPL	"He walked impassive through the cities of men, and sighed because no vista seemed fully real; because every flash of yellow sunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the first lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once known, and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew how to find."
HPL	"As I looked, a subtle, curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion; and oddly enough, I found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression."
HPL	"He was comely, even as thou, but full of folly and strangeness; and he ran away when small to find those who would listen gladly to his songs and dreams."
HPL	"The stones in the crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp, and there was an accursed smell everywhere, as of the piled up corpses of dead generations."
HPL	There was a formula a sort of list of things to say and do which I recognised as something black and forbidden; something which I had read of before in furtive paragraphs of mixed abhorrence and fascination penned by those strange ancient delvers into the universe's guarded secrets whose decaying texts I loved to absorb.
HPL	"Later it developed that he was none other than Lord Northam, of whose ancient hereditary castle on the Yorkshire coast so many odd things were told; but when Williams tried to talk of the castle, and of its reputed Roman origin, he refused to admit that there was anything unusual about it."
HPL	"I must get away from evil shadowed Innsmouth and accordingly I began to test my cramped, wearied powers of locomotion."
HPL	"One man with Oriental eyes has said that all time and space are relative, and men have laughed."
HPL	"The months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts to force the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault, and in carefully guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the structure."
HPL	"Then we turned to the left into High Street, where the going was smoother; flying by stately old mansions of the early republic and still older colonial farmhouses, passing the Lower Green and Parker River, and finally emerging into a long, monotonous stretch of open shore country."
HPL	Nor can I doubt that every detail of this massive product was fashioned from the virgin hillside rock of our planet.
HPL	"As I gazed, I perceived that my own brain held the key to these enchanting metamorphoses; for each vista which appeared to me, was the one my changing mind most wished to behold."
HPL	"all grey, with kinder blue or purple rings . . ."
HPL	"There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern of a daemon galleon."
HPL	"Out of that crash came darkness, and I heard the shrieking of men and of things which were not men."
HPL	"Eli Liddeason, the other servant, constantly complained of weakness; and would have returned to his father's farm in Rehoboth but for a sudden attachment for Mehitabel Pierce, who was hired to succeed Hannah."
HPL	"The whippoorwills were piping wildly, and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritual."
HPL	"There were recent rumours, too, with a baffling and disconcerting amount of agreement."
HPL	"Later traded to Jacques Caboche, another settler, it was in lost in a game of chess or poker to a newcomer named Hans Zimmerman; being used by him as a beer stein until one day, under the spell of its contents, he suffered it to roll from his front stoop to the prairie path before his home where, falling into the burrow of a prairie dog, it passed beyond his power of discovery or recovery upon his awaking."
HPL	"At the Y.M.C.A., where I was stopping, the clerk merely discouraged my going to such a dismal, decadent place; and the people at the library shewed much the same attitude."
HPL	"Men advised one another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered."
HPL	"Other traditions tell of foul odours near the hill crowning circles of stone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines; while still others try to explain the Devil's Hop Yard a bleak, blasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass blade will grow."
HPL	Obed finally got her married off by a trick to an Arkham feller as didn't suspect nothin'.
HPL	"The aspect of that ruin I cannot describe I must have been mad, for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed, splendid and column cinctured, the flame reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountain top."
HPL	"On this occasion he spoke of the perils to be faced, and exhorted the men of Olathoë, bravest of the Lomarians, to sustain the traditions of their ancestors, who when forced to move southward from Zobna before the advance of the great ice sheet even as our descendants must some day flee from the land of Lomar, valiantly and victoriously swept aside the hairy, long armed, cannibal Gnophkehs that stood in their way."
HPL	"Everything he saw was unspeakably menacing and horrible; and whenever one of the organic entities appeared by its motions to be noticing him, he felt a stark, hideous fright which generally jolted him awake."
HPL	but God I dare not tell you what I saw . . .
HPL	"Of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenish yellow ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a curious discolouration behind it."
HPL	"There were bones badly crushed and splintered, but clearly recognisable as human whose manifestly modern date conflicted puzzlingly with the remote period at which their only possible lurking place, the low, slant floored loft overhead, had supposedly been sealed from all human access."
HPL	"Barzai was wise in the lore of earth's gods, and listened hard for certain sounds, but Atal felt the chill of the vapours and the awe of the night, and feared much."
HPL	they took Bennett and Tobey first . . . on each side of us. . .
HPL	"Mansion after mansion claimed my gaze, most of them decrepit and boarded up amidst neglected grounds, but one or two in each street shewing signs of occupancy."
HPL	"For years they stole over the wall each month when they could, and by stealth performed sartain acts."
HPL	"Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit."
HPL	Fear had lurked on Tempest Mountain for more than a century.
HPL	"Thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water, and saw that the grey rock Akurion, which was wont to rear high above it near the shore, was almost submerged."
HPL	Could it be that I was face to face with intellectual emanations which would explain the mystery if I could but learn to discover and read them?
HPL	"Once more came the voice of my friend, still hoarse with fear, and now apparently tinged with despair: ""I can't tell you, Carter It's too utterly beyond thought I dare not tell you no man could know it and live Great God I never dreamed of THIS"" Stillness again, save for my now incoherent torrent of shuddering inquiry."
HPL	"Over hidden wires strange messages travelled, and much was said of still stranger messages yet to travel; but most of this was not guessed till afterward,when the Western Land was safe from the peril."
HPL	"One night about eleven the pump of the refrigerating machine broke down, so that within three hours the process of ammonia cooling became impossible."
HPL	dripping death astride a Bacchanale of bats from night black ruins of buried temples of Belial. . . .
HPL	"He was the only one as kep' on with the East Injy an' Pacific trade, though Esdras Martin's barkentine Malay Pride made a venter as late as 'twenty eight."
HPL	"I am now, however, resolv'd to unburthen myself of a Secret which I have hitherto kept thro' Dread of Incredulity; and to impart to the Publick a true knowledge of my long years, in order to gratifie their taste for authentick Information of an Age with whose famous Personages I was on familiar Terms."
HPL	"It was deep; far deeper than anyone but Randolph suspected, for the boy had found a fissure in the farthermost black corner that led to a loftier grotto beyond a haunting sepulchral place whose granite walls held a curious illusion of conscious artifice."
HPL	"How, I often asked myself, could the stolid imagination of a Catskill degenerate conjure up sights whose very possession argued a lurking spark of genius?"
HPL	"Much was expected of it; and as a few twitching motions began to appear, I could see the feverish interest on West's face."
HPL	"After much patient instruction regarding its focussing and use, they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road; and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around."
HPL	"The speaker had asked for the custody of the cannibal monster committed from Arkham sixteen years before; and upon being refused, gave a signal which precipitated a shocking riot."
HPL	"Most of these, however, soon shewed their poverty and barrenness; and he saw that the popular doctrines of occultism are as dry and inflexible as those of science, yet without even the slender palliative of truth to redeem them."
HPL	"""Hey, yew, why dun't ye say somethin'?"
HPL	"The thing actually opened its eyes, but only stared at the ceiling with a look of soul petrifying horror before collapsing into an inertness from which nothing could rouse it."
HPL	It was the silent first comer who had burned his books.
HPL	"""This is the last time for you, old bird"" he exclaimed furiously."
HPL	"He had wild and original ideas on the independent vital properties of organic cells and nerve tissue separated from natural physiological systems; and achieved some hideous preliminary results in the form of never dying, artificially nourished tissue obtained from the nearly hatched eggs of an indescribable tropical reptile."
HPL	"Seems they get a queer crowd there, for this fellow heard voices in other rooms though most of 'em was empty that gave him the shivers."
HPL	"Birch, in his ghastly situation, was now too low for an easy scramble out of the enlarged transom; but gathered his energies for a determined try."
HPL	"It is still spectral, but its strangeness fascinates me, and I shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building."
HPL	"He saw that Rice, from the party's point of vantage above and behind the entity, had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with marvellous effect."
HPL	"These fragments, as Armitage recalls them, ran something like ""N'gai, n'gha'ghaa, bugg shoggog, y'hah; Yog Sothoth, Yog Sothoth. . ."
HPL	"Before seating himself across the table from me, my host paused for a moment as if in embarrassment; then, tardily removing his gloves, wide brimmed hat, and cloak, stood theatrically revealed in full mid Georgian costume from queued hair and neck ruffles to knee breeches, silk hose, and the buckled shoes I had not previously noticed."
HPL	Behind him tiers of higher terraces towered aloft as far as he could see.
HPL	"Then he thought he heerd another faint like saound over towards Wizard Whateley's a kinder rippin' or tearin' o' wood, like some big box er crate was bein' opened fur off."
HPL	"Pronounced well by his physician, he returned to his quarters in three days; but to Professor Angell he was of no further assistance."
HPL	"Sometimes he and Paul Choynski and Landlord Dombrowski thought they saw that light seeping out of cracks in the sealed loft above the young gentleman's room, but they had all agreed not to talk about that."
HPL	"Then, when the mist would lift and the sea stand out prosy with the smoke of steamers, he would sigh and descend to the town, where he loved to thread the narrow olden lanes up and down hill, and study the crazy tottering gables and odd pillared doorways which had sheltered so many generations of sturdy sea folk."
HPL	Shall I say that the voice was deep; hollow; gelatinous; remote; unearthly; inhuman; disembodied?
HPL	All this had undoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old Maria Robbins.
HPL	"There had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years; and Wilcox's imagination had been keenly affected."
HPL	"Yet the houses remained, despite the ravages of the years and the storms and worms, for they had been made to serve many a generation."
HPL	"At the start, the western wall had lain some twenty feet up a precipitous lawn from the roadway; but a widening of the street at about the time of the Revolution sheared off most of the intervening space, exposing the foundations so that a brick basement wall had to be made, giving the deep cellar a street frontage with door and two windows above ground, close to the new line of public travel."
HPL	He knew things he didn't dare put into that stupid Magnalia or that puerile Wonders of the Invisible World.
HPL	"That Hallowe'en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire burned on Sentinel Hill as usual; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted Whateley farmhouse."
HPL	"My head, heavy and reeling, drooped to my breast, and when next I looked up it was in a dream; with the Pole Star grinning at me through a window from over the horrible swaying trees of a dream swamp."
HPL	"After dark a rattling was heard at the door leading from the cellar into the courtyard; and a stable boy saw Arthur Jermyn, glistening from head to foot with oil and redolent of that fluid, steal furtively out and vanish on the black moor surrounding the house."
HPL	And in front of the fireplace was no vestige of the giant doubled up form in nitre.
HPL	"Castro, apparently, had told the truth when he said that it was wholly secret."
HPL	Do not think from my slavery to morphine that I am a weakling or a degenerate.
HPL	They were the very old folk who dwelt higher up in the hills and spoke a choppy language which the Vascones could not understand.
HPL	"On May Eve of there were tremors which even the Aylesbury people felt, whilst the following Hallowe'en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronised with bursts of flame ""them witch Whateleys' doin's"" from the summit of Sentinel Hill."
HPL	My parents I never knew.
HPL	"The tail of that sinuous line of night marchers seemed very horrible, and as I saw them wriggling into a venerable tomb they seemed more horrible still."
HPL	"The phantasmal, unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in March, , in a field hospital behind the lines at St. Eloi."
HPL	"After the Civil War all industrial life was confined to the Marsh Refining Company, and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing."
HPL	"My uncle breathed heavily, his deep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside, and punctuated by another nerve racking sound of distant dripping water within for the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather, and in this storm positively swamp like."
HPL	"Zadok now grew shriller, and seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech."
HPL	"Kadath in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath?"
HPL	I am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination.
HPL	"At first content to view the scene as an all observant uncorporeal presence, I now desired to define my relation to it, and to speak my mind amongst the grave men who conversed each day in the public squares."
HPL	"Everything was wrong, with the broad window shewing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was ancient, and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below."
HPL	"I could not at first understand the change, but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it."
HPL	"Out of the darkness immediately ahead burst a final shriek from the Mexican, which was joined by such a chorus of uncouth sound as I could never hear again and survive."
HPL	The Elmer Fryes had been erased from Dunwich.
HPL	"Disliking the dinginess of the single restaurant I had seen, I bought a fair supply of cheese crackers and ginger wafers to serve as a lunch later on."
HPL	"It was not easy to find a good opening for two doctors in company, but finally the influence of the university secured us a practice in Bolton a factory town near Arkham, the seat of the college."
HPL	"For a second I thought this typical physique suggested some picture I had seen, perhaps in a book, under circumstances of particular horror or melancholy; but this pseudo recollection passed very quickly."
HPL	"I looked at the cot, the chairs, the instruments, my neglected hat, and the yellowed straw hat of my uncle."
HPL	But I was not to reach my destination without one very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality.
HPL	"By this time Pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and was politely holding open the door for me; asking me if I would care to see his ""modern studies""."
HPL	Yes the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the Whateley farmhouse less than three years before.
HPL	"When the husband and father deserted his family, the mother took the child to Jermyn House; where there was none left to object to her presence."
HPL	"Instead of the hillside tomb, it was the charred cellar on the crest of the slope whose presiding daemon beckoned to me with unseen fingers."
HPL	"It is doubtful whether he was touched at all by the horror and exquisite weirdness of his position, but the bald fact of imprisonment so far from the daily paths of men was enough to exasperate him thoroughly."
HPL	"Then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind, and even in the underbrush of Sentinel Hill itself."
HPL	"The picture was very vivid for a while, but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception; that of utter, absolute solitude in infinite, sightless, soundless space."
HPL	"The patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space, and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister."
HPL	"Finally our combined strength loosened the stone, which we raised and tipped to one side."
HPL	"It was hurt, but not destroyed."
HPL	"Then one summer day he was turned out of his garret, and wandered aimlessly through the streets, drifting over a bridge to a place where the houses grew thinner and thinner."
HPL	"That night as Gilman slept the violet light broke upon him with heightened intensity, and the old witch and small furry thing getting closer than ever before mocked him with inhuman squeals and devilish gestures."
HPL	"Looking for the youth Vercellius, our guide, we found only a crumpled heap weltering in a pool of blood."
HPL	"Some secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind, and this seemed to me one of them."
HPL	"There was no sleep for either of them that night, but next day they both cut classes and drowsed."
HPL	"I suppose one should start in the cold December of , when the ground froze and the cemetery delvers found they could dig no more graves till spring."
HPL	"There were two armlets, a tiara, and a kind of pectoral; the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagance."
HPL	It was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the broad Pacific that the packet of which I was supercargo fell a victim to the German sea raider.
HPL	What ensued can best be gathered from the tales of servants and from things and papers later examined.
HPL	"He led me out of that tangle of alleys in another direction, it seems, for when we sighted a lamp post we were in a half familiar street with monotonous rows of mingled tenement blocks and old houses."
HPL	"""I remember the twilight, the moon, and soft songs, and the window where I was rocked to sleep."
HPL	And the young men who had returned dwelt there no longer.
HPL	"They say that that haunting memory face is modelled from my own, as it was at twenty five, but upon the marble base is carven a single name in the letters of Attica 'ΥΠΝΟΣ."
HPL	"It was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night, and especially during their main festivals or revivals, which fell twice a year on April th and October st."
HPL	"This belief had early led me to contemplate the possibility of telepathy or mental communication by means of suitable apparatus, and I had in my college days prepared a set of transmitting and receiving instruments somewhat similar to the cumbrous devices employed in wireless telegraphy at that crude, pre radio period."
HPL	"They are on the Duke's Wedding, and so much resemble in Quality the Work of other and more recent poetick Dunces, that I cannot forbear copying them: ""When the Duke of Leeds shall marry'd be To a fine young Lady of high Quality How happy will that Gentlewoman be In his Grace of Leeds' good Company."""
HPL	"With joy the sculptors hailed the Tyrant's offer, so that in the days that followed their slaves heard the ceaseless blows of chisels."
HPL	"Their croaking, baying voices, clearly used for articulate speech, held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked."
HPL	"All in all, he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion; yet in my gratitude for his healing I could not well abandon him to the strangers around him, and was careful to dust his room and attend to his needs each day, muffled in a heavy ulster which I bought especially for the purpose."
HPL	"Of his own condition he could not well judge, for sight of his arms, legs, and torso seemed always cut off by some odd disarrangement of perspective; but he felt that his physical organisation and faculties were somehow marvellously transmuted and obliquely projected though not without a certain grotesque relationship to his normal proportions and properties."
HPL	Then I noticed a few inhabited houses with rags stuffed in the broken windows and shells and dead fish lying about the littered yards.
HPL	"The jumble of French changed to a cry in English, and the hoarse voice shouted excitedly, ""My breath, my breath"" Then the awakening became complete, and with a subsidence of facial expression to the normal state my uncle seized my hand and began to relate a dream whose nucleus of significance I could only surmise with a kind of awe."
HPL	One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard.
HPL	"He could not walk, it appeared, and the emerging moon must have witnessed a horrible sight as he dragged his bleeding ankles toward the cemetery lodge; his fingers clawing the black mould in brainless haste, and his body responding with that maddening slowness from which one suffers when chased by the phantoms of nightmare."
HPL	"And they say that the Terrible Old Man talks to these bottles, addressing them by such names as Jack, Scar Face, Long Tom, Spanish Joe, Peters, and Mate Ellis, and that whenever he speaks to a bottle the little lead pendulum within makes certain definite vibrations as if in answer."
HPL	"There had been aeons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities."
HPL	"Sometimes at twilight the grey vapours of the horizon have parted to grant me glimpses of the ways beyond; and sometimes at night the deep waters of the sea have grown clear and phosphorescent, to grant me glimpses of the ways beneath."
HPL	"It was my last link with a chapter of life forever closed, and I valued it highly."
HPL	"And one night, sitting alone in the darkness of the olive grove, Kalos died."
HPL	"For though the wind had not left much snow, a few patches did remain on the path near the door; and in that fleeting backward look it seemed to my troubled eyes that they bore no mark of passing feet, not even mine."
HPL	"In the early evening we rose to the surface, and found the sea less heavy."
HPL	"We could not get bodies fresh enough to shew any trace of reason when reanimated, so had perforce created nameless horrors."
HPL	"As the hour for its arrival drew near I noticed a general drift of the loungers to other places up the street, or to the Ideal Lunch across the square."
HPL	"He was, like Boethius and nearly all the eminent men of his age, of the great Anician family, and traced his genealogy with much exactitude and self satisfaction to all the heroes of the republic."
HPL	"It was the same for more than an hour, when the final throaty rattle came."
HPL	"Advancing, I peered over the edge of that chasm which no line could fathom, and which was now a pandemonium of flickering flame and hideous uproar."
HPL	You'll notice a little in Sargent if you take his bus.
HPL	"I fancied that night had come suddenly upon me, and vainly groped with one free hand for a window embrasure, that I might peer out and above, and try to judge the height I had attained."
HPL	"It had already begun as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool sheds had been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock."
HPL	I had not quite crossed the street when I heard a muttering band advancing along Washington from the north.
HPL	"The next spring no more pale grass and strange weeds came up in the shunned house's terraced garden, and shortly afterward Carrington Harris rented the place."
HPL	"The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred."
HPL	"In the tentacles this was observable as a deepening of the greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly greyish white in the spaces between the purple rings."
HPL	"During this description I had kept a tight rein on my emotions, but my face must have betrayed my mounting fears."
HPL	"I was now shaking with a deadly fear, and the bearded man almost had to hold me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror, the faint lamp i.e., that formerly on the table, not the still fainter lantern he had brought in his free hand."
HPL	"He granted for the sake of argument that some unnatural monster had really existed, but reminded me that even the most morbid perversion of Nature need not be unnamable or scientifically indescribable."
HPL	"Baffled, the excavators sought a conference with the Superintendent, who ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit, and spliced and lowered without cessation till a bottom might be discovered."
HPL	"Slightly later, when a change and a gentle tremor seemed to affect the dead limbs, West stuffed a pillow like object violently over the twitching face, not withdrawing it until the corpse appeared quiet and ready for our attempt at reanimation."
HPL	"His fright, turning to steely despair, left room for a resurgence of his rage against me; and he staggered a step toward the table on whose edge I was steadying myself."
HPL	"Imitating Pickman's listening, I fancied I heard a faint scurrying sound somewhere, and a series of squeals or bleats in a direction I couldn't determine."
HPL	"I saw the blurred outlines of the room, but from some point in space there seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognisable shapes or clouds, penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right of me."
HPL	"My stricken friend moved them to no pity, but what they found on the couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me, and now a fame which I spurn in despair as I sit for hours, bald, grey bearded, shrivelled, palsied, drug crazed, and broken, adoring and praying to the object they found."
HPL	The young gentleman had better be sure to wear the crucifix Joe Mazurewicz had given him.
HPL	There was a secret which even torture could not extract.
HPL	"I was now in a vortex of sound and motion, with confused pictures before my eyes."
HPL	Those who once knew him as scholar and aesthete say it is very pitiful to see him now.
HPL	"As the day advanced the focus of his unseeing eyes changed position, and by noon he had conquered the impulse to stare at vacancy."
HPL	"On March d, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman Street."
HPL	But are not the dreams of poets and the tales of travellers notoriously false?
HPL	"Then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond, where the Manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in Kingsport Head and veer off toward Cape Ann."
HPL	Wait till I ring for coffee.
HPL	"He was merely crass of fibre and function thoughtless, careless, and liquorish, as his easily avoidable accident proves, and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average citizen within certain limits fixed by taste."
HPL	"He cut himself off hurriedly, and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction."
HPL	"And the boy said to him: ""Art thou not indeed he of whom the archons tell, who seekest a far city in a fair land?"
HPL	"Excavated back into the hillside, the structure is visible only at the entrance."
HPL	"It must have been frightful I could hear the screams up here in spite of all I was seeing and hearing from another direction, and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of clothes around the house."
HPL	"Kuranes had awaked the very moment he beheld the city, yet he knew from his brief glance that it was none other than Celephaïs, in the Valley of Ooth Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills, where his spirit had dwelt all the eternity of an hour one summer afternoon very long ago, when he had slipt away from his nurse and let the warm sea breeze lull him to sleep as he watched the clouds from the cliff near the village."
HPL	"So little is known of what went on beneath the surface so little, yet such a ghastly festering as it bubbles up putrescently in occasional ghoulish glimpses."
HPL	"There is unknown magic on Hatheg Kla, for the screams of the frightened gods have turned to laughter, and the slopes of ice shoot up endlessly into the black heavens whither I am plunging. . . ."
HPL	"The next day, it appears, they raised and landed on a small island, although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean; and six of the men somehow died ashore, though Johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story, and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm."
HPL	"I was slow, too, in realising that the school of unusual dolphins had vanished."
HPL	I was also sorry that I had no one with whom to converse.
HPL	"Sometimes it enters directly into the composition of the events, while sometimes it relates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places."
HPL	"As I gradually steadied myself and got readjusted to this second room of deviltry and morbidity, I began to analyse some of the points in my sickening loathing."
HPL	"Our freedom from long sleep was surprising, for seldom did we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace."
HPL	"For now, when the wind sweeps boisterous out of the north past the high ancient house that is one with the firmament, there is broken at last that ominous brooding silence ever before the bane of Kingsport's maritime cotters."
HPL	His sole relief was obtained in revelry of the most general and boisterous sort; so that few assemblies of the young and the gay were unknown to us.
HPL	"Whether or not he will ever come back, I cannot say."
HPL	"The small, weather worn telephone poles carried only two wires."
HPL	"What I did was to faint silently away, just as I had done in that brier choked railway cut a year before."
HPL	"Whilst Barzai was shouting these things Atal felt a spectral change in the air, as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws; for though the way was steeper than ever, the upward path was now grown fearsomely easy, and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face."
HPL	"Suddenly that face became dim and quickly disappeared, and in a brief space I found myself projected against an obstacle which I could not penetrate."
HPL	"Against these assertions I have no tangible proof to offer, since my key to the padlock was lost in the struggle on that night of horrors."
HPL	"It was I who thought of the deserted Chapman farmhouse beyond Meadow Hill, where we fitted up on the ground floor an operating room and a laboratory, each with dark curtains to conceal our midnight doings."
HPL	"Dr. Barnard unbuckled the leathern harness and did not restore it till night, when he succeeded in persuading Slater to don it of his own volition, for his own good."
HPL	"Ast 'em whar they come from, an' ef they cud git more, an' finally wormed the story aout o' the old chief Walakea, they called him."
HPL	"This, however, implied that all roads leading out of Innsmouth were similarly patrolled; for the denizens could not have known what route I intended to take."
HPL	Where if anywhere had he been on those nights of daemoniac alienage?
HPL	"The city below stretched away to the limits of vision, and he hoped that no sound would well up from it."
HPL	The touch of brain fever and the dreams began early in February.
HPL	"If you had moved, they would have been at you long ago."
HPL	"The squatters there, mostly primitive but good natured descendants of Lafitte's men, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night."
HPL	"The vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay, and as we approached along the now descending road I could see that many roofs had wholly caved in."
HPL	"I had been scrambling in this way for some time, so that my battery had burned very low, when the passage suddenly inclined sharply upward, altering my mode of progress."
HPL	"""Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face that haff face on top of it . . ."
HPL	"Let them prosecute and persecute above ground things went on every day that they couldn't reach, and voices laughed at night that they couldn't place ""Why, man, out of ten surviving houses built before and not moved since I'll wager that in eight I can shew you something queer in the cellar."
HPL	"Wilcox, I was sure, had heard of the cult in some casual way, and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and imagining."
HPL	"It might be actively hostile, or it might be dictated merely by blind motives of self preservation."
HPL	"He dropped them all years ago, and no one feels sure whether he left the country or merely sank from sight in some hidden byway."
HPL	"The procession of clerics began filing down the steep stairs through the trap door in the floor, turning and making menacing gestures as they left."
HPL	"Finally I saw a green litten plain far below me, and discerned on it the twisted towers of a city built in no fashion I had ever known or read of or dreamed of."
HPL	"I must find Bennett and Tobey, if they lived . . ."
HPL	"He felt vaguely glad that all his relatives were distant and out of touch with him, for they could not have understood his mental life."
HPL	"But when the moon went over to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore, I saw in that light old spires that the waves almost uncovered, and white columns gay with festoons of green seaweed."

HPL	It was the pit the maelstrom the ultimate abomination.
HPL	"The moon no longer shone through the chinks and apertures above me, and with a sense of fateful alarm I heard the sinister and significant rumble of approaching thunder."
HPL	"I went to the war, an' ef I'd a had any guts or sense I'd a never come back, but settled away from here."
HPL	"Only the sombre philosophy of the Decadents could hold us, and this we found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diabolism of our penetrations."

HPL	"Trident bearing Neptune was there, and sportive tritons and fantastic nereids, and upon dolphins' backs was balanced a vast crenulate shell wherein rode the grey and awful form of primal Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss."
HPL	"The mill hands were of somewhat turbulent inclinations; and besides their many natural needs, their frequent clashes and stabbing affrays gave us plenty to do."
HPL	"He wrote this in a very ancient hand, and when I still hesitated he pulled from his loose robe a seal ring and a watch, both with my family arms, to prove that he was what he said."
HPL	His occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine guardians.
HPL	"Nothing has been distorted or concealed, and if anything remains vague, it is only because of the dark cloud which has come over my mind that cloud and the nebulous nature of the horrors which brought it upon me."
HPL	"All the townsfolk were frightened, and had begged the presence of a cohort from Calagurris."
HPL	There was no way the law or anything else could reach the society.
HPL	"Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed."
HPL	"The more he reflected on the hellish diary, the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which Wilbur Whateley had left behind him the earth threatening entity which, unknown to him, was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable Dunwich horror."
HPL	Had he actually slipped outside our sphere to points unguessed and unimaginable?
HPL	"It is an unfortunate fact that the bulk of humanity is too limited in its mental vision to weigh with patience and intelligence those isolated phenomena, seen and felt only by a psychologically sensitive few, which lie outside its common experience."
HPL	"""Git aout o' here Git aout o' here They seen us git aout fer your life Dun't wait fer nothin' they know naow Run fer it quick aout o' this taown "" Another heavy wave dashed against the loosening masonry of the bygone wharf, and changed the mad ancient's whisper to another inhuman and blood curdling scream."
HPL	"He found the spectral gossip of the town much diminished, and it is indeed a fact that notwithstanding certain reports of a ghostly tittering in the deserted house which lasted almost as long as that edifice itself no fresh appearances either of old Keziah or of Brown Jenkin have been muttered of since Gilman's death."
HPL	"I did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard, but sought with some subtlety to draw him out."
HPL	"Yet these conceptions were formulated in rustic words wholly inadequate to convey them, a circumstance which drove me to the conclusion that if a true dream world indeed existed, oral language was not its medium for the transmission of thought."
HPL	Herbert West needed fresh bodies because his life work was the reanimation of the dead.
HPL	Flashes of lightning were visible through the bunk house window.
HPL	"These lights were seen as late as , but toward the last they became very infrequent."
HPL	"It is all that remains of my friend; the friend who led me on to madness and wreckage; a godlike head of such marble as only old Hellas could yield, young with the youth that is outside time, and with beauteous bearded face, curved, smiling lips, Olympian brow, and dense locks waving and poppy crowned."

HPL	"Then she up an' spoke suddent of a fearful smell, an' says her boy Cha'ncey was a screamin' as haow it was jest like what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin'."
HPL	"On the far, misty horizon I could just make out the dizzy profile of the Head, topped by the queer ancient house of which so many legends are told; but for the moment all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me."
HPL	At any rate he kicked and squirmed frantically and automatically whilst his consciousness was almost eclipsed in a half swoon.

HPL	"As I approached the arch I began to perceive the presence more clearly; and then, with the first and last sound I ever uttered a ghastly ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious cause I beheld in full, frightful vividness the inconceivable, indescribable, and unmentionable monstrosity which had by its simple appearance changed a merry company to a herd of delirious fugitives."

HPL	"In another instant I was knocked from my gruesome bench by the devilish threshing of some unseen entity of titanic size but undetermined nature; knocked sprawling on the root clutched mould of that abhorrent graveyard, while from the tomb came such a stifled uproar of gasping and whirring that my fancy peopled the rayless gloom with Miltonic legions of the misshapen damned."

HPL	There were all sorts of rumours about how Marsh had come to look.
HPL	"This late winter night there had been such a match; evidently with disastrous results, since two timorous Poles had come to us with incoherently whispered entreaties to attend to a very secret and desperate case."
HPL	"A poverty but little above the level of dire want, together with a pride of name that forbids its alleviation by the pursuits of commercial life, have prevented the scions of our line from maintaining their estates in pristine splendour; and the falling stones of the walls, the overgrown vegetation in the parks, the dry and dusty moat, the ill paved courtyards, and toppling towers without, as well as the sagging floors, the worm eaten wainscots, and the faded tapestries within, all tell a gloomy tale of fallen grandeur."
HPL	"Old Keziah, he reflected, might have had excellent reasons for living in a room with peculiar angles; for was it not through certain angles that she claimed to have gone outside the boundaries of the world of space we know?"

HPL	"I recalled what he had said of the pineal gland, and wondered what he saw with this preternatural eye."
HPL	The change happened whilst I slept.
HPL	"God knows, though, that the prosy tale which George Birch's death permits me to tell has in it aspects beside which some of our darkest tragedies are light."
HPL	"He had not been at Oxford for nothing, nor talked to no account with an ancient chymist and astrologer in Paris."
HPL	"Of this he had been assured by Frank Elwood, the one fellow student whose poverty forced him to room in this squalid and unpopular house."

HPL	"My father seemed to notice it, too, for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly."
HPL	"Puerile though the story was, old Zadok's insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow."
HPL	Then there was a more subtle fear a very fantastic sensation resulting from a curious experiment in the Canadian army in .
HPL	"They was a party one night as follered Obed's craowd aout to the reef, an' I heerd shots betwixt the dories."
HPL	"But as time passed, men observed a want of gaiety in the once sparkling Musides."
HPL	"I was very sorry for him, for I dislike to see a German suffer; but he was not a good man to die with."
HPL	"The whippoorwills an' fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o' Gawd, an' they's them as says ye kin hear strange things a rushin' an' a talkin' in the air daown thar ef ye stand in the right place, atween the rock falls an' Bear's Den."""

HPL	"When he complained, and longed to escape into twilight realms where magic moulded all the little vivid fragments and prized associations of his mind into vistas of breathless expectancy and unquenchable delight, they turned him instead toward the new found prodigies of science, bidding him find wonder in the atom's vortex and mystery in the sky's dimensions."

HPL	"Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of titan blocks and sky flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror."
HPL	"The air grew perceptibly colder, more suddenly so than is usual at November's brink, and seemed stirred by terrible undulations which I could not help connecting with the beating of huge wings."
HPL	"Perhaps the strain had been too great; for Dr. Muñoz made it whisperingly clear though not in detail that the methods of healing had been most extraordinary, involving scenes and processes not welcomed by elderly and conservative Galens."

HPL	"All this aggressive mechanism we set in the cellar in positions carefully arranged with reference to the cot and chairs, and to the spot before the fireplace where the mould had taken strange shapes."
HPL	"Very little concerning this skeleton has leaked out, but the workmen who found it whisper in shocked tones about the long, brownish hairs with which it was associated."
HPL	"""O Aira, city of marble and beryl, how many are thy beauties How loved I the warm and fragrant groves across the hyaline Nithra, and the falls of the tiny Kra that flowed through the verdant valley In those groves and in that vale the children wove wreaths for one another, and at dusk I dreamed strange dreams under the yath trees on the mountain as I saw below me the lights of the city, and the curving Nithra reflecting a ribbon of stars."

HPL	For that the man always watched and listened no one could doubt.
HPL	"In another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty, though in so doing he was careful to take with him Shang the blacksmith and Thul the cutter of stone as witnesses."

HPL	"We know things, he said, only through our five senses or our religious intuitions; wherefore it is quite impossible to refer to any object or spectacle which cannot be clearly depicted by the solid definitions of fact or the correct doctrines of theology preferably those of the Congregationalists, with whatever modifications tradition and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle may supply."

HPL	"It was closer to Maple Hill than to Cone Mountain, some of the crude abodes indeed being dugouts on the side of the former eminence."

HPL	From far shores came those white sailed argosies of old; from far Eastern shores where warm suns shine and sweet odours linger about strange gardens and gay temples.
HPL	"Thereafter I was more cautious with my incantations, for I had no wish to be cut off from my body and from the earth in unknown abysses whence I could never return."
HPL	"With strange art were they builded, for no other city had houses like them; and travellers from Thraa and Ilarnek and Kadatheron marvelled at the shining domes wherewith they were surmounted."
HPL	I had been there about three weeks when the first odd incident occurred.
HPL	"They've ben telling things about Innsmouth whispering 'em, mostly for the last hundred years, I guess, and I gather they're more scared than anything else."
HPL	"Then he commenced whispering as in awe: ""El ritmo, Señor el ritmo de la tierra THAT THROB DOWN IN THE GROUND"" And now I also heard; heard and shivered and without knowing why."
HPL	"In time he observed a further mystery the tendency of certain entities to appear suddenly out of empty space, or to disappear totally with equal suddenness."
HPL	"Asellius; and the legatus of the whole region, Cn."
HPL	"When Professor Angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams."
HPL	Mr. Czanek had never before noticed the colour of that man's eyes; now he saw that they were yellow.
HPL	"Suddenly out of the blackness the madly sawing bow struck me, and I knew I was close to the player."
HPL	"My rage was unbounded, yet my German sense forbade me to venture unprepared into an utterly black interior which might prove the lair of some indescribable marine monster or a labyrinth of passages from whose windings I could never extricate myself."
HPL	"The shriek of fright and impotent malice emitted by the would be assassin proved too much for my already shaken nerves, and I fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faint."
HPL	"For the cat is cryptic, and close to strange things which men cannot see."
HPL	In the summer it would be nearly overhead.
HPL	"Now the work of drainage was ready to begin, and the labourers from the north were soon to strip the forbidden bog of its green moss and red heather, and kill the tiny shell paved streamlets and quiet blue pools fringed with rushes."
HPL	The thing must have happened at about three thirty in the afternoon.
HPL	"We only realised, with the blackest of apprehensions, that the apparently disembodied chatter was beyond a doubt in the Dutch language."
HPL	"That suggestive patch, by the way, was only faintly visible when we placed our furniture and instruments, and when we returned that evening for the actual vigil."
HPL	"Mercy should have known better than to hire anyone from the Nooseneck Hill country, for that remote bit of backwoods was then, as now, a seat of the most uncomfortable superstitions."
HPL	"He assures me on his professional honour that Joe Slater was but a low grade paranoiac, whose fantastic notions must have come from the crude hereditary folk tales which circulate in even the most decadent of communities."
HPL	"A town able to inspire such dislike in its neighbours, I thought, must be at least rather unusual, and worthy of a tourist's attention."
HPL	"they rattled our door, but pa wouldn't open . . ."
HPL	"I did not like everything about what I saw, and felt again the fear I had had."
HPL	"That he was right, I soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed."
HPL	"South of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient Bishop house, which was built before ; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls, built in , form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen."
HPL	"You might as well say, you have a strong Suspicion that Milton wrote Paradise Lost"" I thereafter saw Johnson very frequently, most often at Meetings of THE LITERARY CLUB, which was founded the next Year by the Doctor, together with Mr. Burke, the parliamentary Orator, Mr. Beauclerk, a Gentleman of Fashion, Mr. Langton, a pious Man and Captain of Militia, Sir J. Reynolds, the widely known Painter, Dr. Goldsmith, the prose and poetick Writer, Dr. Nugent, father in law to Mr. Burke, Sir John Hawkins, Mr. Anthony Chamier, and my self."
HPL	"Through all the years Wilbur had treated his half deformed albino mother with a growing contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on May Eve and Hallowmass; and in the poor creature complained to Mamie Bishop of being afraid of him."
HPL	It was at this point that there came a knocking on the door; that ancient door of nail studded oak beyond which lay only the abyss of white cloud.
HPL	Beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous things; half seen columns of unsanctified temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness.
HPL	"Barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and goings, and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a god himself."
HPL	"In a moment I understood that he meant to open the hatch and plunge with me into the water outside, a vagary of suicidal and homicidal mania for which I was scarcely prepared."
HPL	"But when two days later the squatters told me what the red glare meant, I felt more horror than that which the mould burrow and the claw and eyes had given; more horror because of the overwhelming implications."
HPL	"He did not employ the music rack, but offering no choice and playing from memory, enchanted me for over an hour with strains I had never heard before; strains which must have been of his own devising."
HPL	I did not like the way he looked at healthy living bodies; and then there came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when I learned that a certain specimen had been a living body when he secured it.
HPL	"The urge to walk was gradually changing to an urge to leap mystically into space, and suddenly he realised just where the source of the pull lay."
HPL	A certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike.
HPL	"Morbid art doesn't shock me, and when a man has the genius Pickman had I feel it an honour to know him, no matter what direction his work takes."
HPL	"West had still another source of worry, for he had been called in the afternoon to a case which ended very threateningly."
HPL	To this day I do not know whether they saw me or not.
HPL	"He stopped in his tracks then, flailing his arms wildly in the air, began to stagger backward."
HPL	"My first impulse on awaking was to communicate all my fears and observations to Denys Barry, but as I saw the sunlight glowing through the latticed east window I became sure that there was no reality in what I thought I had seen."
HPL	Once more I say that I have no clear idea of our object on that night.
HPL	"Glancing at the people on the sidewalks, I thought I detected in them a curious wish to avoid looking at the bus or at least a wish to avoid seeming to look at it."
HPL	The old bookseller had told him that only five copies were known to have survived the shocked edicts of the priests and lawgivers against it and that all of these were locked up with frightened care by custodians who had ventured to begin a reading of the hateful black letter.
HPL	"Of my own race I was permitted to learn singularly little, yet what small knowledge of it I was able to gain, seemed to depress me much."
HPL	"I told them of my dream, but they were not interested till I spoke of the weird sounds I thought I had heard."
HPL	"On the third day Slater was found unconscious in the hollow of a tree, and taken to the nearest gaol; where alienists from Albany examined him as soon as his senses returned."
HPL	"Gilman sat in a daze all the afternoon, and Elwood who had meanwhile seen the papers and formed terrible conjectures from them found him thus when he came home."
HPL	"He was evidently given to working or lounging around the fish docks, and carried with him much of their characteristic smell."
HPL	The legend here seemed to present three variants.
HPL	"Sir Alfred Jermyn was a baronet before his fourth birthday, but his tastes never matched his title."
HPL	"It was from these that I determined to choose a colleague, and the more I reflected the more my preference inclined toward one Arthur Munroe, a dark, lean man of about thirty five, whose education, taste, intelligence, and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences."
HPL	"The cries were shocking; and as I stood in the brilliant apartment alone and dazed, listening to their vanishing echoes, I trembled at the thought of what might be lurking near me unseen."
HPL	Then I thought with renewed force of what the factory inspector had heard in the night in this mouldering and pestilential building.
HPL	"On my asking him what he thought of my favourable Notice of his Dictionary in The Londoner, my periodical Paper, he said: ""Sir, I possess no Recollection of having perus'd your Paper, and have not a great Interest in the Opinions of the less thoughtful Part of Mankind."""
HPL	"God knows it was not of this world or no longer of this world yet to my horror I saw in its eaten away and bone revealing outlines a leering, abhorrent travesty on the human shape; and in its mouldy, disintegrating apparel an unspeakable quality that chilled me even more."
HPL	"Just what the white ape like creatures could have been, Mwanu had no idea, but he thought they were the builders of the ruined city."
HPL	"As the first violence of Musides' grief gave place to resignation, he laboured with diligence upon his figure of Tyché."
HPL	"It was not allied to the European witch cult, and was virtually unknown beyond its members."
HPL	"On the th, as my impulse to search out the mystery of the temple waxed still more insistent, a great disappointment befell me; for I found that the materials needed to replenish the portable light had perished in the mutiny of those pigs in July."
HPL	Early risers on the th noticed a peculiar stench in the air.
HPL	"Recurrent sheet lightnings illumed the tumbled ground and the remains of the curious low hummock which had stretched down from the wooded higher slope, but there was nothing in the chaos to shew my place of egress from the lethal catacomb."
HPL	"Over the bog was a deluge of flaring light, scarlet and sinister, and pouring from the strange olden ruin on the far islet."
HPL	"It likewise became clear that, since the same solution never worked alike on different organic species, he would require human subjects for further and more specialised progress."
HPL	But all agreed on one thing: that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious.
HPL	"He had grown as large as a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker."
HPL	"It may have been gold, but I did not pause to examine it, for I was strangely affected by that which I had undergone."
HPL	"An hour later darkness found him in the open fields beyond Hangman's Brook, with the glimmering spring stars shining ahead."
HPL	"I was rather glad to be rid of Müller, for even his silence had unfavourably affected the crew."
HPL	Spells might be all right but suppose they weren't?
HPL	"Donning these, he reached for the volume on the table and turned the pages lovingly."
HPL	"He was vastly jealous of Dr. Johnson, tho' none the less liking and respecting him."
HPL	I think I went mad then.
HPL	"In the marble streets were marble pillars, the upper parts of which were carven into the images of grave bearded men."
HPL	"Cha'ncey he says they leads off into the medders, whar a great swath wider'n a barn is matted daown, an' all the stun walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes."
HPL	At Sabbat time it always mounted and reached through to the worlds to summon the initiate to nameless rites.
HPL	"During the 'nineties he dabbled in Satanism, and at all times he devoured avidly any doctrine or theory which seemed to promise escape from the close vistas of science and the dully unvarying laws of Nature."
HPL	"He was principal of the East High School, born and bred in Boston and sharing New England's self satisfied deafness to the delicate overtones of life."
HPL	"The skull turned my stomach, but the other was worse those ankles cut neatly off to fit Matt Fenner's cast aside coffin"" Nyarlathotep . . . the crawling chaos . . ."
HPL	Mebbe he's tried it already they do sometimes go daown fer little spells afore they go fer good.
HPL	"When these things palled, disappointed, or grew nauseous through revulsion, they cultivated irony and bitterness, and found fault with the social order."
HPL	"I know that light is not for me, save that of the moon over the rock tombs of Neb, nor any gaiety save the unnamed feasts of Nitokris beneath the Great Pyramid; yet in my new wildness and freedom I almost welcome the bitterness of alienage."
HPL	It had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the old woman's spinning wheel.
HPL	"With him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss to determine."
HPL	"They were grave and quiet, and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed quivering."
HPL	"After Barry had told me these things I was very drowsy, for the travels of the day had been wearying and my host had talked late into the night."
HPL	"It had looked at me as it died, and its eyes had the same odd quality that marked those other eyes which had stared at me underground and excited cloudy recollections."
HPL	I felt conscious of youth because I remembered so little.
HPL	"He would often awake calling for his mother and grandfather, both in their graves a quarter of a century."
HPL	"For a second nobody dared to turn on the light, then Armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch."
HPL	"ye yelping dog ye called 'em, and they've come for me Moccasined feet dead men Gad sink ye, ye red devils, but I poisoned no rum o' yours han't I kept your pox rotted magic safe?"
HPL	"Jermyn could form no conjecture, but by close questioning obtained a very picturesque legend of the stuffed goddess."
HPL	Three years later he died.
HPL	"The day was warm and sunny, but the landscape of sand, sedge grass, and stunted shrubbery became more and more desolate as we proceeded."
HPL	They must be up to something.
HPL	"His blue eyes were bulging, glassy, and sightless, and the frantic playing had become a blind, mechanical, unrecognisable orgy that no pen could even suggest."
HPL	"Some distance away the lifeless body of Juan Romero lay upon a table, surrounded by a group of men, including the camp doctor."
HPL	"Each would have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others, and it was only half heartedly that they searched vainly, as it proved for some portable souvenir to bear away."
HPL	"He speeded up his car as he passed it, and did not slacken till he had mounted the hill where his mother and her fathers before her were born, and where the old white house still looked proudly across the road at the breathlessly lovely panorama of rocky slope and verdant valley, with the distant spires of Kingsport on the horizon, and hints of the archaic, dream laden sea in the farthest background."
HPL	"Then the bank defaulter remembered the picture, and suggested that it be viewed and filed for identification at police headquarters."
HPL	"Wal, it's this it ain't what them fish devils hez done, but what they're a goin' to do They're a bringin' things up aout o' whar they come from into the taown ben doin' it fer years, an' slackenin' up lately."
HPL	At this point the first excited speaker interrupted.
HPL	"Once a student of reanimation, this silent trunk was now gruesomely called upon to exemplify it."
HPL	"Keep still"" The combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me a kind of paralysis, and in my terror my mind again opened to the impressions coming from what Tillinghast called ""beyond""."
HPL	"I felt, in my visions, a cosmic and abysmal loneness; with hostility surging from all sides upon some prison where I lay confined."
HPL	"As he spoke, I caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam from a solitary attic window."
HPL	"Clearly, in the eyes of the educated, Innsmouth was merely an exaggerated case of civic degeneration."
HPL	"There he stayed long, gazing out over the bright harbour where the ripples sparkled beneath an unknown sun, and where rode lightly the galleys from far places over the water."
HPL	"Over and above the fumes and sickening closeness rises an aroma once familiar throughout the land, but now happily banished to the back streets of life by the edict of a benevolent government the aroma of strong, wicked whiskey a precious kind of forbidden fruit indeed in this year of grace ."
HPL	"West was a materialist, believing in no soul and attributing all the working of consciousness to bodily phenomena; consequently he looked for no revelation of hideous secrets from gulfs and caverns beyond death's barrier."
HPL	"Then there was heavy, deliberate tramping in the cottage, and Olney heard the windows opening, first on the north side opposite him, and then on the west just around the corner."
HPL	"With the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiar and I wish, for normality's sake, there were nothing more to tell."
HPL	But more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret lore of ocean.
HPL	"There were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms, and these I proceeded to fasten."
HPL	"At first I would tiptoe up to my old fifth floor, then I grew bold enough to climb the last creaking staircase to the peaked garret."
HPL	"Gilman could not be very clear about his reasons for this last assumption, but his haziness here was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex points."
HPL	"How strange seemed the denizens with their walking sticks, tall beavers, and cropped heads New sounds came from the distance first strange puffings and shrieks from the river a mile away, and then, many years later, strange puffings and shrieks and rumblings from other directions."
HPL	Meanwhile he would try to keep track of his somnambulism.
HPL	"Saturday the th I spent in total darkness, tormented by thoughts and memories that threatened to overcome my German will."
HPL	"The high backed settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left, and seemed to be occupied, though I was not sure."
HPL	"Before long I was pretty nearly a devotee, and would listen for hours like a schoolboy to art theories and philosophic speculations wild enough to qualify him for the Danvers asylum."
HPL	"That, Pickman said, was the kind of thing he had been talking about an aperture of the network of tunnels that used to undermine the hill."
HPL	My impulse to visit and enter the temple has now become an inexplicable and imperious command which ultimately cannot be denied.
HPL	"In either case it would have been appropriate; for the unexpected tenacity of the easy looking brickwork was surely a sardonic commentary on the vanity of mortal hopes, and the source of a task whose performance deserved every possible stimulus."
HPL	"That item, gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors, seemed indeed rather far fetched; since the low, black reef lies a full mile and a half out from Innsmouth Harbour."
HPL	"We read much in Alhazred's Necronomicon about its properties, and about the relation of ghouls' souls to the objects it symbolised; and were disturbed by what we read."
HPL	"For an instant I felt absolute despair, since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete."
HPL	"That was it, by heaven The man was not a fantaisiste or romanticist at all he did not even try to give us the churning, prismatic ephemera of dreams, but coldly and sardonically reflected some stable, mechanistic, and well established horror world which he saw fully, brilliantly, squarely, and unfalteringly."
HPL	"The Jermyns never seemed to look quite right something was amiss, though Arthur was the worst, and the old family portraits in Jermyn House shewed fine faces enough before Sir Wade's time."
HPL	"When they got old an' begun to shew it, they was kep' hid until they felt like takin' to the water an' quittin' the place."
HPL	The rays were now perceptibly dimmer than they had been during the weeks of drifting.
HPL	"In my enthusiasm I became nearly as idiotic and sentimental as poor Klenze, and was very tardy in noticing that the southward current had ceased at last, allowing the U to settle slowly down upon the sunken city as an aëroplane settles upon a town of the upper earth."
HPL	"""That was before the big epidemic of , when over half the folks in Innsmouth was carried off."
HPL	"Ahead was the robed black man he had seen in the peaked space in the other dream, while from a lesser distance the old woman was beckoning and grimacing imperiously."
HPL	Within twenty four hours the stranger had become so bright that it outshone Capella.
HPL	"We approached the house from the field in the rear, took the specimen in the back door and down the cellar stairs, and prepared it for the usual experiment."
HPL	"It can, though, do a lot of harm; so we mustn't hesitate to rid the community of it."
HPL	"Much of my time was now occupied in the exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of the old chateau, which in youth fear had caused me to shun, and some of which, old Pierre had once told me, had not been trodden by human foot for over four centuries."
HPL	"The facade, of immense magnitude, apparently covers a continuous hollow recess; for its windows are many and widely distributed."
HPL	"Soon to our ears came the distant thunder of falling waters, and to our eyes appeared on the far horizon ahead the titanic spray of a monstrous cataract, wherein the oceans of the world drop down to abysmal nothingness."
HPL	"Parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of green crusted rock to the boat, and Johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which shouldn't have been there; an angle which was acute, but behaved as if it were obtuse."
HPL	"Seizing the green jade object, we gave a last glance at the bleached and cavern eyed face of its owner and closed up the grave as we found it."
HPL	"The next day both youths felt very tired, and knew they would sleep like logs when night came."
HPL	"It is not permitted me to tell your waking earth self of your real self, but we are all roamers of vast spaces and travellers in many ages."
HPL	"As the mist thickened, Olney crept around to the windows on the north and west and south sides, trying them but finding them all locked."
HPL	"When she got Sally Sawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop's, the nearest place to Whateley's, it became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally's boy Chauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill toward Whateley's, and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the pasturage where Mr. Bishop's cows had been left out all night."
HPL	"Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino woman of thirty five, living with an aged and half insane father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth."
HPL	"But the bearded man said to me: ""Beware of those perilous seas wherein men say Cathuria lies."
HPL	"And, as I have implied, it was not of the dead man himself that I became afraid."
HPL	"I had, I felt, been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully passed."
HPL	"Extremists sometimes said the house was ""unlucky"", but that is as far as even they went."
HPL	"I saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic, and when I had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the greatest shrewdness and judgment."
HPL	Whether I believe them now I honestly do not know.
HPL	"Dr. Muñoz, most certainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, and discrimination."
HPL	Two had been killed; perhaps that had finished it.
HPL	"I think we screamed ourselves as we stumbled frantically toward the town, though as we reached the outskirts we put on a semblance of restraint just enough to seem like belated revellers staggering home from a debauch."
HPL	"ten or twenty maouths or trunks a stickin' aout all along the sides, big as stovepipes, an' all a tossin' an' openin' an' shuttin' . . ."
HPL	"He himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors, and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said, or at least all that had caused him to say what he did; relapsing into a bovine, half amiable normality like that of the other hill dwellers."
HPL	"On a slab in an alcove he found an old but empty coffin whose tarnished plate bears the single word ""Jervas""."
HPL	He had come in an aëroplane piloted by the intrepid Lieut.
HPL	"Here have another drink I need one anyhow There's no use in my trying to tell you what they were like, because the awful, the blasphemous horror, and the unbelievable loathsomeness and moral foetor came from simple touches quite beyond the power of words to classify."
HPL	"On a verdant slope of Mount Maenalus, in Arcadia, there stands an olive grove about the ruins of a villa."
HPL	"Then he would have recourse to the polite laughter they had taught him to use against the extravagance and artificiality of dreams; for he saw that the daily life of our world is every inch as extravagant and artificial, and far less worthy of respect because of its poverty in beauty and its silly reluctance to admit its own lack of reason and purpose."
HPL	"And as the muffled thunder clattered, those eyes still stared with vacuous viciousness."
HPL	Gradually I came to wonder what might be my place in that city on the strange plateau betwixt strange peaks.
HPL	"An inappropriate hour, a jarring lighting effect, or a clumsy manipulation of the damp sod, would almost totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which followed the exhumation of some ominous, grinning secret of the earth."
HPL	"Again I say, I do not know what has become of Harley Warren; though I think almost hope that he is in peaceful oblivion, if there be anywhere so blessed a thing."
HPL	"The darkness always teemed with unexplained sound and yet he sometimes shook with fear lest the noises he heard should subside and allow him to hear certain other, fainter, noises which he suspected were lurking behind them."
HPL	"He got this in London, I guess he uster like ter buy things at the shops."
HPL	"This original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest."
HPL	"Johansen's address, I discovered, lay in the Old Town of King Harold Haardrada, which kept alive the name of Oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as ""Christiana""."
HPL	"For a long hour the watchers gazed, whilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew thicker and more restless."
HPL	"As the afternoon progressed, I sought the lower levels, descending into what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of confinement, or a more recently excavated storehouse for gunpowder."
HPL	For it had been a man.
HPL	"The slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch, but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background."
HPL	And before Goya you have to go back to the mediaeval chaps who did the gargoyles and chimaeras on Notre Dame and Mont Saint Michel.
HPL	"I am a singer of songs that I learned in the far city, and my calling is to make beauty with the things remembered of childhood."
HPL	"They had hanged four kinsmen of mine for witchcraft in , but I did not know just where."
HPL	"College had all but closed, and every doctor of the medical faculty was helping to fight the typhoid plague."
HPL	"In a second I was through, and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward."
HPL	The night of the first revelation was a sultry one.
HPL	"She was intoning some croaking ritual in a language which Gilman could not understand, but which seemed like something guardedly quoted in the Necronomicon."
HPL	"I am Romnod, and born of the blood of Teloth, but am not old in the ways of the granite city, and yearn daily for the warm groves and the distant lands of beauty and song."
HPL	"Among the others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan, men to whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two he motioned to accompany him inside."
HPL	He must ask Frank Elwood for help.
HPL	"Men whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked aloud of the sight within the king's banquet hall, where through the windows were seen no longer the forms of Nargis Hei and his nobles and slaves, but a horde of indescribable green voiceless things with bulging eyes, pouting, flabby lips, and curious ears; things which danced horribly, bearing in their paws golden platters set with rubies and diamonds containing uncouth flames."
HPL	"The fanged, furry thing began tittering a continuation of the unknown ritual, while the witch croaked loathsome responses."
HPL	And the organs never would work again.
HPL	"There dwelt in that ghastly and flexible face, as it shone bodiless, luminous, and rejuvenated in the blackness, more of stark, teeming, brain shattering fear than all the rest of heaven and earth has ever revealed to me."
HPL	"Once inside one of the decrepit brick structures I would have to reckon with pursuit; but I hoped to descend and dodge in and out of yawning doorways along the shadowed courtyard, eventually getting to Washington Street and slipping out of town toward the south."
HPL	"The Marshes, together with the other three gently bred families of the town the Waites, the Gilmans, and the Eliots were all very retiring."
HPL	"All my days have I watched it and listened to it, and I know it well."
HPL	According to one story nothing further happened save that the stuffed goddess became a symbol of supremacy for whatever tribe might possess it.
HPL	"Despite my most careful searches and investigations, I have never since been able to find the Rue d'Auseil."
HPL	It should be a matter of general knowledge that Cf. is responsible for this work.
HPL	"For a season all went happily, till without warning the storm burst."
HPL	"Looks like a terrible rattletrap I've never ben on it."""
HPL	"All in the band of the faithful Order o' Dagon an' the children shud never die, but go back to the Mother Hydra an' Father Dagon what we all come from onct Iä Iä Cthulhu fhtagn Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah nagl fhtagn "" Old Zadok was fast lapsing into stark raving, and I held my breath."
HPL	"On neither occasion, though, had Gilman been there and when told of the matter he wondered where he could have been wandering, barefoot and with only his night clothes on."
HPL	"One might easily imagine an alien nucleus of substance or energy, formless or otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible or immaterial subtractions from the life force or bodily tissues and fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself."
HPL	"All this I can still remember, though I no longer know what manner of thing we sought."
HPL	"Everyone listened, and everyone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness."
HPL	"I had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild, disjointed, and incredible legends, and I had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking to him; yet the thought of this aged witness to the town's decay, with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories, was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist."
HPL	As soon as possible I visited the grave of Jan Martense and dug vainly where I had dug before.
HPL	"The picture is blurred, but ineradicable."
HPL	"Next there came to me the impression of light amidst the darkness of dead batteries, and I seemed to see a sort of phosphorescent glow in the water through the porthole which opened toward the temple."
HPL	"About two o'clock he went out for lunch, and as he threaded the narrow lanes of the city he found himself turning always to the southeast."
HPL	"I shall ask him when I see him, for I expect to meet him shortly in a certain dream city we both used to haunt."
HPL	"His age was perhaps thirty five, but the odd, deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull, expressionless face."
HPL	"It was a secret room, far, far underground; where huge winged daemons carven of basalt and onyx vomited from wide grinning mouths weird green and orange light, and hidden pneumatic pipes ruffled into kaleidoscopic dances of death the lines of red charnel things hand in hand woven in voluminous black hangings."
HPL	"He had a lot of talk about diet, and said Pickman must be abnormal and eccentric to the last degree."
HPL	I can still see Herbert West under the sinister electric light as he injected his reanimating solution into the arm of the headless body.
HPL	But something would have to be done about those rats.
HPL	"Toward the end of March he began to pick up in his mathematics, though other studies bothered him increasingly."
HPL	"There are secrets, you know, which might have come down from old Salem times, and Cotton Mather tells even stranger things."
HPL	"That at least two of the fear's embodiments were destroyed, formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety in this Acheron of multiform diabolism; yet I continued my quest with even greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrous."
HPL	"By the second day of the search the affair was fully treated by the newspapers, whose reporters overran Tempest Mountain."
HPL	"D'ye know, young Sir, I'm right sot on this un here."
HPL	"But such was the aspect of Crawford Tillinghast on the night his half coherent message brought me to his door after my weeks of exile; such the spectre that trembled as it admitted me, candle in hand, and glanced furtively over its shoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient, lonely house set back from Benevolent Street."
HPL	"Whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice hanging underbrush."
HPL	"Into the sky the spires of its temples reached, so that no man might behold their peaks; and far back beyond the horizon stretched the grim, grey walls, over which one might spy only a few roofs, weird and ominous, yet adorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures."
HPL	"Everybody shrieked when a large rat like form suddenly jumped out from beneath the ensanguined bedclothes and scuttled across the floor to a fresh, open hole close by."
HPL	I can see him now as he was then and I shiver.
HPL	Heaven be thanked for the instinct which led me unconscious to places where men dwell; to the peaceful village that slept under the calm stars of clearing skies.
HPL	Not long after this Pickman produced a flashlight and revealed an antediluvian ten panelled door that looked damnably worm eaten.
HPL	The neighbours grumblingly acquiesced in the inertia but the foetor none the less formed an additional count against the place.
HPL	"I know not why I went thither unless to pray, or gibber out insane pleas and apologies to the calm white thing that lay within; but, whatever my reason, I attacked the half frozen sod with a desperation partly mine and partly that of a dominating will outside myself."
HPL	"There were lights inside the house when I came upon it, and I saw from the diamond window panes that it must have been kept very close to its antique state."
HPL	"The six remaining pigs of seamen, suspecting that we were lost, had suddenly burst into a mad fury at our refusal to surrender to the Yankee battleship two days before; and were in a delirium of cursing and destruction."
HPL	h'ehye n'grkdl'lh. . .
HPL	"Psychologically my case is most interesting, and I regret that it cannot be observed scientifically by a competent German authority."
HPL	"West had a private laboratory in an east room of the barn like temporary edifice, assigned him on his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for the treatment of hitherto hopeless cases of maiming."
HPL	"Unrest and treason were abroad amongst an evil few who plotted to strike the Western Land its death blow, that they might mount to power over its ruins; even as assassins had mounted in that unhappy, frozen land from whence most of them had come."
HPL	That was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream.
HPL	"That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible."
HPL	You might have surmised I had some inside information when I dropped him and that's why I don't want to think where he's gone.
HPL	He had evidently sought refuge on the very ship which had been forced to destroy his own one more victim of the unjust war of aggression which the English pig dogs are waging upon the Fatherland.
HPL	"It was certainly nervous waiting, and the blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so."
HPL	"""Then fur ahead where Bishop's Brook goes under the rud he heerd a awful creakin' an' strainin' on the bridge, an' says he could tell the saound o' wood a startin' to crack an' split."
HPL	Nor were there any sea fowl to prey upon the dead things.
HPL	Beasts balk at the critters hosses wuss'n mules but when they got autos that was all right.
HPL	"All men paid homage to Kalos and Musides, and marvelled that no shadow of artistic jealousy cooled the warmth of their brotherly friendship."
HPL	So without delay West had injected into the body's wrist the compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival.
HPL	"My mind, as alert as my senses, recognised the gravely unusual; and almost automatically I leaped up and turned about to grasp the destructive instruments which we had left trained on the mouldy spot before the fireplace."
HPL	"Around the creature's neck had been found a golden chain bearing an empty locket on which were armorial designs; no doubt some hapless traveller's keepsake, taken by the N'bangus and hung upon the goddess as a charm."
HPL	"But he could not play to another his weird harmonies, and could not bear hearing them from another; nor could he bear having anything in his room touched by another."
HPL	"Around him in the damp, low ceiled library with the musty white panelling, heavy carved overmantel, and small paned, vine shaded windows, were the relics and records of his ancient family, among which were many dubious allusions to the shunned house in Benefit Street."
HPL	Something very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen.
HPL	"There was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape, but we dressed the thing and carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows, as we had carried a similar thing one horrible night in Arkham."
HPL	"I felt ahead, touched the back of Zann's chair, and then found and shook his shoulder in an effort to bring him to his senses."
HPL	"They had all kinds o' cities on the sea bottom, an' this island was heaved up from thar."
HPL	"I was scientifically interested in those dolphins; for though the ordinary Delphinus delphis is a cetacean mammal, unable to subsist without air, I watched one of the swimmers closely for two hours, and did not see him alter his submerged condition."
HPL	"On the morning of September th Professor Rice and Dr. Morgan insisted on seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and ashen grey."
HPL	"Presently they began to gather renewed force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate frenzy."
HPL	And on what remained of his chewed and gouged head there was no longer a face.
HPL	"It is, for instance, not often that a young physician leaving college is obliged to conceal the principles which guide his selection of a home and office, yet that was the case with Herbert West."
HPL	"It had not left behind quite all that it had attacked, for sometimes it had been hungry."
HPL	"In any case, I would aim to strike Washington somehow and get quickly out of the Town Square region."
HPL	"No, Thurber, these ancient places are dreaming gorgeously and overflowing with wonder and terror and escapes from the commonplace, and yet there's not a living soul to understand or profit by them."
HPL	"It was here that he first came into conflict with the college authorities, and was debarred from future experiments by no less a dignitary than the dean of the medical school himself the learned and benevolent Dr. Allan Halsey, whose work in behalf of the stricken is recalled by every old resident of Arkham."
HPL	"Alien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers know, but we recognised it as the thing hinted of in the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred; the ghastly soul symbol of the corpse eating cult of inaccessible Leng, in Central Asia."
HPL	"The reality of what I had been through was highly uncertain in my mind, but I felt that something hideous lay in the background."
HPL	"The immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway; and I now saw that the safest course was ahead to Babson Street, then west to Lafayette there edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one I had traversed and subsequently back northward and westward in a zigzagging line through Lafayette, Bates, Adams, and Bank Streets the latter skirting the river gorge to the abandoned and dilapidated station I had seen from my window."
HPL	And yet I could extract nothing definite from the man.
HPL	"I shivered as I wondered why I did not reach the light, and would have looked down had I dared."
HPL	"I think that these things were supposed to depict men at least, a certain sort of men; though the creatures were shewn disporting like fishes in the waters of some marine grotto, or paying homage at some monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the waves as well."
HPL	"After the close of the American war he was heard of as a sailor on a merchantman in the African trade, having a kind of reputation for feats of strength and climbing, but finally disappearing one night as his ship lay off the Congo coast."
HPL	"Once I partly awaked, probably because the sleeper toward the window had restlessly flung an arm across my chest."
HPL	"The curator of the historical society there Mr. E. Lapham Peabody was very courteous about assisting me, and expressed unusual interest when I told him I was a grandson of Eliza Orne of Arkham, who was born in and had married James Williamson of Ohio at the age of seventeen."
HPL	"Shaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now resolved to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo."
HPL	"I had been living in many poor places, always evicted for want of money; until at last I came upon that tottering house in the Rue d'Auseil, kept by the paralytic Blandot."
HPL	"To seek rescue in the lifeboats would be to deliver ourselves into the hands of enemies unreasonably embittered against our great German nation, and our wireless had failed ever since the Victory affair to put us in touch with a fellow U boat of the Imperial Navy."
HPL	"Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot."
HPL	"Maybe Harvard wun't be so fussy as yew be."""
HPL	"The Martense mansion was built in by Gerrit Martense, a wealthy New Amsterdam merchant who disliked the changing order under British rule, and had constructed this magnificent domicile on a remote woodland summit whose untrodden solitude and unusual scenery pleased him."
HPL	"It was from a youthful reverie filled with speculations of this sort that I arose one afternoon in the winter of , when to the state psychopathic institution in which I served as an interne was brought the man whose case has ever since haunted me so unceasingly."
HPL	"Yes, that paper was the reason I dropped Pickman; Richard Upton Pickman, the greatest artist I have ever known and the foulest being that ever leaped the bounds of life into the pits of myth and madness."
HPL	"Their appearance especially those staring, unwinking eyes which one never saw shut was certainly shocking enough; and their voices were disgusting."
HPL	"Nor was any spot in that city more steeped in macabre memory than the gable room which harboured him for it was this house and this room which had likewise harboured old Keziah Mason, whose flight from Salem Gaol at the last no one was ever able to explain."
HPL	You know it's always ben a kind of mystery where the Marshes get the gold they refine.
HPL	"And so the prisoner toiled in the twilight, heaving the unresponsive remnants of mortality with little ceremony as his miniature Tower of Babel rose course by course."
HPL	"In the Book of Invaders it is told that these sons of the Greeks were all buried at Tallaght, but old men in Kilderry said that one city was overlooked save by its patron moon goddess; so that only the wooded hills buried it when the men of Nemed swept down from Scythia in their thirty ships."
HPL	Alone I buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had loved to wander in life.
HPL	"Upon that sea the hateful moon shone, and over its unvocal waves weird perfumes brooded."
HPL	"Other specimens the youth had not seen, though many were rumoured to exist around Innsmouth."
HPL	"So numerous were they, that Kuranes almost mistook them for an army, but their leader told him they were sent in his honour; since it was he who had created Ooth Nargai in his dreams, on which account he was now to be appointed its chief god for evermore."
HPL	"Rough and scabby, and the sides of their necks are all shrivelled or creased up."
HPL	"I knew we must have passed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of Kingsport itself, and I shivered that a town should be so aged and maggoty with subterraneous evil."
HPL	"""Eh ya ya ya yahaah e'yayayayaaaa . . ."
HPL	"But such naive reports could mean very little, and Gilman let the cheap metal crucifix hang idly from a knob on his host's dresser."
HPL	"But neither ship nor land appeared, and I began to despair in my solitude upon the heaving vastnesses of unbroken blue."
HPL	"Through his puzzlement a voice piped, and he started again at its familiarity after long years."
HPL	"As a child Lord Northam had had peculiar dreams when sleeping in the older parts of the castle, and had acquired a constant habit of looking back through his memory for half amorphous scenes and patterns and impressions which formed no part of his waking experience."
HPL	"Therein walk only daemons and mad things that are no longer men, and the streets are white with the unburied bones of those who have looked upon the eidolon Lathi, that reigns over the city."""
HPL	"Of his vast collection of strange, rare books on forbidden subjects I have read all that are written in the languages of which I am master; but these are few as compared with those in languages I cannot understand."
HPL	When the driver came out of the store I looked at him more carefully and tried to determine the source of my evil impression.
HPL	It was as if the workmanship were that of another planet.
HPL	"West had greedily seized the lifeless thing which had once been his friend and fellow scholar; and I shuddered when he finished severing the head, placed it in his hellish vat of pulpy reptile tissue to preserve it for future experiments, and proceeded to treat the decapitated body on the operating table."
HPL	This time neither could doubt but that something hideously serious was closing in around them.
HPL	"No one placed the charred fragments in an urn or set a memorial to him who had been; for certain papers and a certain boxed object were found, which made men wish to forget."
HPL	"There Mazurewicz had found something monstrous or thought he had, for no one else could quite agree with him despite the undeniable queerness of the prints."
HPL	"It must have been some imp of the perverse or some sardonic pull from dark, hidden sources which made me change my plans as I did."
HPL	"He did not succeed, and motioned to me to come to his assistance."
HPL	In some places they was little stones strewed abaout like charms with somethin' on 'em like what ye call a swastika naowadays.
HPL	"Their creeds were heterodox and mysterious, involving hints of certain marvellous transformations leading to bodily immortality of a sort on this earth."
HPL	"He was calmer than I as he forced a large quantity of his fluid into a vein of the body's arm, immediately binding the incision securely."
HPL	"At last the spring thaw came, and graves were laboriously prepared for the nine silent harvests of the grim reaper which waited in the tomb."
HPL	"As may well be imagined, I gave up most of the foreplanned features of the rest of my tour the scenic, architectural, and antiquarian diversions on which I had counted so heavily."
HPL	"For on the faces of this throng was writ a madness born of horror unendurable, and on their tongues were words so terrible that no hearer paused for proof."
HPL	"Then I spoke with the bearded man, and told him of my new yearnings to depart for remote Cathuria, which no man hath seen, but which all believe to lie beyond the basalt pillars of the West."
HPL	"Dogs had a fear of me, for they felt the outside shadow which never left my side."
HPL	"A struggle, a needle, and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a very fresh corpse, and the experiment had succeeded for a brief and memorable moment; but West had emerged with a soul calloused and seared, and a hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous and calculating appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous physique."
HPL	"Many days they travelled, and from afar saw lofty Hatheg Kla with his aureole of mournful mist."
HPL	"Soon those shrieks had attained a magnitude and quality which cannot be written of, and which make me faint as I think of them."
HPL	"Of our studies it is impossible to speak, since they held so slight a connexion with anything of the world as living men conceive it."
HPL	As I sat deciphering the execrable French I felt more lenient toward the old man.
HPL	"With it shall go this record of mine this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together again."
HPL	"Now swift and splintering blows assailed the sickly panels, and I saw the gleam of a tomahawk as it cleft the rending wood."
HPL	That gland is the great sense organ of organs I have found out.
HPL	"With the passage of time he became almost glad he had lingered, for his relics of youth and his cleavage from the world made life and sophistication seem very distant and unreal; so much so that a touch of magic and expectancy stole back into his nightly slumbers."
HPL	The youth's eyes glistened and his nostrils curled at the fumes of the brownish fluid which an attendant was pouring out for him.
HPL	"Though of poetic rather than scientific temperament, he planned to continue the work of his forefathers in African ethnology and antiquities, utilising the truly wonderful though strange collection of Sir Wade."
HPL	"I caught the night train to Arkham, and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials there; a process I later repeated in Boston."
HPL	When I had entered the room I had shut the door behind me.
HPL	"The odour of the fish was maddening; but I was too much concerned with graver things to mind so slight an evil, and set out boldly for an unknown goal."
HPL	"Undoubtedly the alien strain in the Innsmouth folk was stronger here than farther inland unless, indeed, the ""Innsmouth look"" were a disease rather than a blood strain, in which case this district might be held to harbour the more advanced cases."
HPL	"I calc'late her man is as good a husban' as ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an' ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn't ast no better church weddin' nor her'n."
HPL	Upon one thing I was absolutely resolved.
HPL	I do not believe I need to wait for the full change as most have waited.
HPL	"Old, white bearded, and ragged, my host possessed a countenance and physique which inspired equal wonder and respect."
HPL	"""It would be too much . . ."
HPL	"At evening Iranon sang, and while he sang an old man prayed and a blind man said he saw a nimbus over the singer's head."
HPL	"For my contact with this affair has been closer than that of any other layman, and I have carried away impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures."
HPL	"All the torches now began to dim, and the cries of frightened legionaries mingled with the unceasing screams of the tethered horses."
HPL	For at a closer glance I saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty.
HPL	"Yes, that was the thing."
HPL	"I had seen it from the road's crest when I looked at Kingsport in the new dusk, and it had made me shiver because Aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the ghostly spire."
HPL	"He nevair go out, only on roof, and my boy Esteban he breeng heem hees food and laundry and mediceens and chemicals."
HPL	"As we heard this suggestion of baying we shuddered, remembering the tales of the peasantry; for he whom we sought had centuries before been found in this selfsame spot, torn and mangled by the claws and teeth of some unspeakable beast."
HPL	"That was the first time he had ever been able to revive the quality of rational thought in a corpse; and his success, obtained at such a loathsome cost, had completely hardened him."
HPL	"Unwholesome recollections of things in the Necronomicon and the Black Book welled up, and he found himself swaying to infandous rhythms said to pertain to the blackest ceremonies of the Sabbat and to have an origin outside the time and space we comprehend."
HPL	"What I have seen would blast ye to a mad statue of stone Back, back forward, forward look, ye puling lack wit"" And as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured anew; bringing to the sky a flash more blinding than either which had come before."
HPL	"A despatch from California describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some ""glorious fulfilment"" which never arrives, whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March."
HPL	"Jan Martense, whose room I had invaded, was buried in the graveyard near the mansion. . . ."
HPL	"I paused and drew into a gaping doorway, reflecting how lucky I was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street."
HPL	"I cannot speak longer, for the body of Joe Slater grows cold and rigid, and the coarse brains are ceasing to vibrate as I wish."
HPL	"The ammonia ceased to drip, and as I cleaned up what had spilled and opened the window for air, I heard the landlady's heavy footsteps above me."
HPL	"I found it in the glare of mid afternoon, in the clangour of a metropolis, and in the teeming midst of a shabby and commonplace rooming house with a prosaic landlady and two stalwart men by my side."
HPL	What I learned and saw in those hours of impious exploration can never be told for want of symbols or suggestions in any language.
HPL	"Selling a portion of his estate to obtain the requisite money, he outfitted an expedition and sailed for the Congo."
HPL	I knew that much of my route must be visible from the Rowley road.
HPL	"I now saw that the hall room above mine the ""leetle room"" of bottles and machines which Mrs. Herrero had mentioned was merely the laboratory of the doctor; and that his main living quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose convenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide all dressers and obtrusive utilitarian devices."
HPL	"They said it had been there before D'Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians, and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods."
HPL	There seemed to be a change in the old man an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event.
HPL	"Other stars anon shall rise To the axis of the skies; Stars that soothe and stars that bless With a sweet forgetfulness: Only when my round is o'er Shall the past disturb thy door."""
HPL	"In the morning Randolph was up early, and would have run off to the upper timber lot if Uncle Chris had not caught him and forced him into his chair by the breakfast table."
HPL	She had found it in the young gentleman's bed on the side next the wall.
HPL	"Outwardly he was the same to the last calm, cold, slight, and yellow haired, with spectacled blue eyes and a general aspect of youth which years and fears seemed never to change."
HPL	"Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between wheel and engines to get the Alert under way."
HPL	"Then silently and gracefully the naiads reached the water and melted one by one into the ancient bog; while the line of followers, never checking their speed, splashed awkwardly after them and vanished amidst a tiny vortex of unwholesome bubbles which I could barely see in the scarlet light."
HPL	"It was of this world, and yet not of it a shadowy geometrical confusion in which could be seen elements of familiar things in most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations."
HPL	So you are busy delving into the shady past of that insufferable young Asiatic Varius Avitus Bassianus?
HPL	Perhaps it is madness that is overtaking me yet perhaps a greater horror or a greater marvel is reaching out.
HPL	When I sounded the archaic iron knocker I was half afraid.
HPL	As I look back across the years I realise how unreal it seems; and sometimes half wonder if old Dr. Fenton was not right when he charged it all to my excited imagination.
HPL	"And their fear and dismay increased when they searched the fallen apartment; for of the gentle Musides, and of the marvellously fashioned image of Tyché, no trace could be discovered."
HPL	"The words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied forth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light, and I sickened at the hollow, altered voice of my host."
HPL	"The sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct, and presently I saw a fairly deep river gorge ahead, spanned by a wide, iron railed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out."
HPL	"The way was rocky, and made perilous by chasms, cliffs, and falling stones."
HPL	"And the shepherd, hearing, looked long and strangely at Iranon, as if recalling something very far away in time, and noted each line of the stranger's face, and his golden hair, and his crown of vine leaves."
HPL	"I shiver as I speak of them, and dare not be explicit; though I will say that my friend once wrote on paper a wish which he dared not utter with his tongue, and which made me burn the paper and look affrightedly out of the window at the spangled night sky."
HPL	"It was unspeakably shocking, and I do not see how I lived through it."
HPL	"But Hiram, loyal to the last, has held faith in me, and has done that which impels me to make public at least a part of my story."
HPL	"Friends and companions he shuns, for he wishes to answer no questions."
HPL	After a time the man left me alone in the attic room.
HPL	"It was tall in front, and with a very large and curiously irregular periphery, as if designed for a head of almost freakishly elliptical outline."
HPL	Some of the faces seemed to hold expressions that brought up incredibly remote recollections; others were utterly alien.
HPL	"Then he went back to Arkham, the terrible witch haunted old town of his forefathers in New England, and had experiences in the dark, amidst the hoary willows and tottering gambrel roofs, which made him seal forever certain pages in the diary of a wild minded ancestor."
HPL	He could not tell they would think him mad.
HPL	"""Wal, come abaout 'thutty eight when I was seven year' old Obed he faound the island people all wiped aout between v'yages."
HPL	"Gilman felt a gnawing, poignant abhorrence shoot through his mental and emotional paralysis, and the light metal bowl shook in his grasp."
HPL	"Their disappearance added horror to the situation of them all West knew the whereabouts of only one, the pitiful asylum thing."
HPL	But for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me.
HPL	But it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and set upon my soul such a seal of fright as may never in life be removed; not that which drew the shrieks and excited the convulsions which caused lodgers and police to break down the door.
HPL	"That object was my uncle the venerable Elihu Whipple who with blackening and decaying features leered and gibbered at me, and reached out dripping claws to rend me in the fury which this horror had brought."
HPL	"It was the pictorial carving, however, that did most to hold me spellbound."
HPL	"The afternoon of my search brought nothing to light, and dusk came as I stood on Maple Hill looking down at the hamlet and across the valley to Tempest Mountain."
HPL	It had been an eldritch thing no wonder sensitive students shudder at the Puritan age in Massachusetts.
HPL	"My friend was dying when I spoke to him, and he could not answer coherently."
HPL	"Some was more teched than others, an' some never did change quite enough to take to the water; but mostly they turned aout jest the way them things said."
HPL	"Old Bugs himself seemed also to belong to the past, for his nondescript clothing bore every hallmark of antiquity."
HPL	But he was great once my fathair in Barcelona have hear of heem and only joost now he feex a arm of the plumber that get hurt of sudden.
HPL	The only one who would talk was a very aged but normal looking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north rim of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fire station.
HPL	"If I say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature, I shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing."
HPL	"Very simple were the things of which they read and spoke, yet things which gave them courage and goodness and helped them by day to subdue the forest and till the fields."
HPL	"On his initiative we combed the countryside for information regarding the terrible Martense family, and discovered a man who possessed a marvellously illuminating ancestral diary."
HPL	"It was from the tethered horses they had screamed, not neighed, but screamed... and there was no light down there, nor the sound of any human thing, to shew why they had done so."
HPL	Noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without even touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window; and for days not counted in men's calendars the tides of far spheres bare him gently to join the dreams for which he longed; the dreams that men have lost.
HPL	To seek to describe it were useless for it was such that no description is possible.
HPL	"Brown Jenkin was rubbing itself with a kind of affectionate playfulness around the ankles of the black man, which the deep mud largely concealed."
HPL	"West, who had his hand on the pulse of the left wrist, suddenly nodded significantly; and almost simultaneously a mist appeared on the mirror inclined above the body's mouth."
HPL	"All, that is, but one."
HPL	"I was a little dazed by this coincidence, but did not become terrified."
HPL	Angarola of Chicago has it.
HPL	"Later, I thought, they might aid me; but I did not want them then."
HPL	"The Deep Ones could never be destroyed, even though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten Old Ones might sometimes check them."
HPL	"By Their smell can men sometimes know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man's truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is Them."
HPL	"It suddenly struck me as very natural that the local people should not wish to ride on a bus owned and driven by this man, or to visit any oftener than possible the habitat of such a man and his kinsfolk."
HPL	We carried the thing down to the laboratory listening.
HPL	"This time, on the fourteenth of November, my quest concerned itself mostly with the slopes of Cone Mountain and Maple Hill where they overlook the unfortunate hamlet, and I gave particular attention to the loose earth of the landslide region on the latter eminence."
HPL	"As I fled from that accursed castle along the bog's edge I heard a new sound; common, yet unlike any I had heard before at Kilderry."
HPL	"I knew in that second all that had been; I remembered beyond the frightful castle and the trees, and recognised the altered edifice in which I now stood; I recognised, most terrible of all, the unholy abomination that stood leering before me as I withdrew my sullied fingers from its own."
HPL	It seems that on that last hideous night Joe had stooped to look at the crimson rat tracks which led from Gilman's couch to the nearby hole.
HPL	"""It's a goin' agin, an' this time by day It's aout it's aout an' a movin' this very minute, an' only the Lord knows when it'll be on us all"" The speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message."
HPL	"Something made him feel that motors did not belong in the realm he was seeking, so he left his car at the edge of the forest, and putting the great key in his coat pocket walked on up the hill."
HPL	Suddenly I myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight.
HPL	"We switched from Tremont up Beacon, and Pickman left me at the corner of Joy, where I turned off."
HPL	"It was not quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside."
HPL	"As I entered the abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle, I became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the shadows."
HPL	"On the green and flowery mountains of Cathuria stand temples of pink marble, rich with carven and painted glories, and having in their courtyards cool fountains of silver, where purl with ravishing music the scented waters that come from the grotto born river Narg."
HPL	"He would not, he found, have to pile another on his platform to make the proper height; for the hole was on exactly the right level to use as soon as its size might permit."
HPL	It was something I found in my coat the next morning.
HPL	"From the air of hushed fright at Osborn's store they knew something hideous had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye house and family."
HPL	"I had heard of them by vague rumour, and realised that they could not be upon any map of today; but the fact that they were forgotten only endeared them to me, so that I had sought them with twice my usual eagerness."
HPL	"With the years the legends take on a spectral character I suppose the thing, if it was a living thing, must have died."
HPL	"I fantastically associated these things with every day events, and thought them more natural than the coloured pictures of living beings which I found in many of the mouldy books."
HPL	"It faced south, with one gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill, and the other exposed to the foundations toward the street."
HPL	"His pleas, however, were wholly in vain; for the decision of Dr. Halsey was inflexible, and the other professors all endorsed the verdict of their leader."
HPL	"Indeed, the greatest problem was to get them fresh enough West had had horrible experiences during his secret college researches with corpses of doubtful vintage."
HPL	"For a decade had it been talked of in the land of Mnar, and as it drew nigh there came to Sarnath on horses and camels and elephants men from Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron, and all the cities of Mnar and the lands beyond."
HPL	"Swarthy and sinister were most of the strangers, yet among them one might find a few faces like those who fashioned The Street and moulded its spirit."
HPL	"At night he would not be alone, nor would the company of a few persons calm him."
HPL	In reply to a jumble of questions they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital fact.
HPL	"Then, as if in response to an insidious motion of my host's hand, a flash of heat lightning played over the scene, and I looked out upon a sea of luxuriant foliage foliage unpolluted, and not the sea of roofs to be expected by any normal mind."
HPL	"West was experimenting madly to find something which would start man's vital motions anew after they had been stopped by the thing we call death, but had encountered the most ghastly obstacles."
HPL	As the man rambled on Gilman felt a nameless panic clutch at his throat.
HPL	"Men of his blood had once ruled over Kilderry and built and dwelt in the castle, but those days were very remote, so that for generations the castle had been empty and decaying."
HPL	"An' jest then our folks organised the Esoteric Order o' Dagon, an' bought Masonic Hall offen Calvary Commandery for it . . ."
HPL	Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror.
HPL	I was glad to see the moonlight again when I emerged from that macabre tunnel.
HPL	"It seemed that he was often absent from his bed, and that the creaking of his floor at certain hours of the night was remarked by the man in the room below."
HPL	"Most of the puzzling was done after her early death, which took place at the birth of my grandmother her only child."
HPL	"So far I had seen no people in the town, but there now came signs of a sparse habitation curtained windows here and there, and an occasional battered motor car at the curb."
HPL	"It undulated too much, and glistened too brightly in the rays of the now westering moon."
HPL	"Members of the Royal Anthropological Institute burned the thing and threw the locket into a well, and some of them do not admit that Arthur Jermyn ever existed."
HPL	"When noises came from it, they whispered and shivered; and hoped that the lock on that attic door was strong."
HPL	"But in Teloth was nothing green, for all was of stone."
HPL	That's haow the Kanakys got wind they was daown thar.
HPL	"From the East tempestuous winds arose, and chilled me as I crouched on the slab of damp stone which had risen beneath my feet."
HPL	"Sawyer, as clumsy as most non users of optical devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focussed the lenses with Armitage's aid."
HPL	"why had it picked them, and left me for the last? . . ."
HPL	"Despite the obvious danger of attracting notice and bringing down on our heads the dreaded police investigation a thing which after all was mercifully averted by the relative isolation of our cottage my friend suddenly, excitedly, and unnecessarily emptied all six chambers of his revolver into the nocturnal visitor."
HPL	"And one night a mighty gulf was bridged, and the dream haunted skies swelled down to the lonely watcher's window to merge with the close air of his room and make him a part of their fabulous wonder."
HPL	"""Let me see, Trever,"" continued the defaulter, ""didn't Schultz say your mother is a literary person, too?"" ""Yes, damn it,"" replied Trever, ""but nothing like the old Teian She's one of those dull, eternal moralisers that try to take all the joy out of life."
HPL	"Miss Tilton, comparing all possible hypotheses regarding its origin and its presence in New England, was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered by old Captain Obed Marsh."
HPL	"He was just dizzy and careless enough to annoy his sensitive horse, which as he drew it viciously up at the tomb neighed and pawed and tossed its head, much as on that former occasion when the rain had vexed it."
HPL	"It was not, indeed, difficult to begin a counter attack, for I knew that Joel Manton actually half clung to many old wives' superstitions which sophisticated people had long outgrown; beliefs in the appearance of dying persons at distant places, and in the impressions left by old faces on the windows through which they had gazed all their lives."
HPL	What the others were in their own dimensional sphere or spheres he dared not try to think.
HPL	"After about an hour he got himself under better control, and saw that he was far from the city."
HPL	"I would not dare,"" he continued to mutter."
HPL	"Descending to Elwood's room he roused his still sleeping host and began telling of how he had found himself, but Elwood could form no idea of what might really have happened."
HPL	"As the hours wore on I saw his head droop awkwardly in sleep, but I did not disturb him."
HPL	The cuttings largely alluded to outré mental illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of .
HPL	"The smell of the sea took on ominous implications, and the silent driver's bent, rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful."
HPL	"The few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the ground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded up second story."
HPL	"There were vague statements about disease and concentration camps, and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons, but nothing positive ever developed."
HPL	Negotium perambulans in tenebris. . . .
HPL	"""Glad to know you, Sheehan,"" said Trever in a quiet, well bred tone."
HPL	"In the electric light the colour seemed to be a kind of iridescent grey veined with green, and Gilman could see amidst his horror and bewilderment that one of the knobs ended in a jagged break corresponding to its former point of attachment to the dream railing."
HPL	But even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defences.
HPL	"There came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic, bloodless looking specimens."
HPL	"Etienne's son Paul, a surly fellow whose erratic conduct had probably provoked the riot which wiped out the family, was particularly a source of speculation; and though Providence never shared the witchcraft panics of her Puritan neighbours, it was freely intimated by old wives that his prayers were neither uttered at the proper time nor directed toward the proper object."
HPL	"He worked largely by feeling now, since newly gathered clouds hid the moon; and though progress was still slow, he felt heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the top and bottom of the aperture."
HPL	"Down unpaved side streets I saw the black, gaping windows of deserted hovels, many of which leaned at perilous and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations."
HPL	"One dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it."
HPL	"His thinking processes, once so phlegmatic and logical, had become ineffaceably scarred; and it was pitiful to note his response to certain chance allusions such as ""Friday"", ""tomb"", ""coffin"", and words of less obvious concatenation."
HPL	"Many were the pillars of the palaces, all of tinted marble, and carven into designs of surpassing beauty."
HPL	"Dombrowski, frantic at the failure of his constant rat poisoning efforts, cast aside all thought of his lease and within a week had moved with all his older lodgers to a dingy but less ancient house in Walnut Street."
HPL	"As the White Ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of Zar, we beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty city; and the bearded man said to me: ""This is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, wherein reside all those mysteries that man has striven in vain to fathom."""
HPL	I affirm I swear that I had no share in these extreme aspirations.
HPL	"Its shrill loathsome tittering stuck more and more in Gilman's head, and he could remember in the morning how it had pronounced the words ""Azathoth"" and ""Nyarlathotep""."
HPL	"In the centre yawns a great open door, reached by an impressive flight of steps, and surrounded by exquisite carvings like the figures of Bacchanals in relief."
HPL	"He acquired a habit of writing long documents of some sort, which he carefully sealed and filled with injunctions that I transmit them after his death to certain persons whom he named for the most part lettered East Indians, but including a once celebrated French physician now generally thought dead, and about whom the most inconceivable things had been whispered."
HPL	"At length, being avid for new strange things and held back by neither the Kingsporter's fear nor the summer boarder's usual indolence, Olney made a very terrible resolve."
HPL	"On August I effected an exit from the U , and laboriously made my way through the ruined and mud choked streets to the ancient river."
HPL	While they were talking Desrochers dropped in to say that he had heard a terrific clattering overhead in the dark small hours.
HPL	Annæus Stilpo half native in blood had sent to Balbutius at Calagurris for a cohort to stamp out the Sabbath on the terrible night.
HPL	"West and I were almost dead, and Dr. Halsey did die on the th."
HPL	"The moon's light flickers, as earth's gods dance against it; I shall see the dancing forms of the gods that leap and howl in the moonlight. . . ."
HPL	"Only the coffins themselves remained as potential stepping stones, and as he considered these he speculated on the best mode of arranging them."
HPL	"But on the night after it was set up in the temple a terrible thing must have happened, for weird lights were seen over the lake, and in the morning the people found the idol gone, and the high priest Taran Ish lying dead, as from some fear unspeakable."
HPL	"The ancient books taken from Whateley's quarters, while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter."
HPL	"Though the northward pull had not diminished, he resisted it as he had resisted the other pull, and finally found that he could almost balance the one against the other."
HPL	"Each transmitted idea formed rapidly in my mind, and though no actual language was employed, my habitual association of conception and expression was so great that I seemed to be receiving the message in ordinary English."
HPL	"For the aeons that I dwelt there I wandered blissfully through gardens where quaint pagodas peep from pleasing clumps of bushes, and where the white walks are bordered with delicate blossoms."
HPL	"May I say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time, and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain half breed red Indians once encamped upon this hill?"
HPL	"It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at A.M. on Sunday, the second of February, ."
HPL	"Mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth, for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few."
HPL	"The decay was worst close to the waterfront, though in its very midst I could spy the white belfry of a fairly well preserved brick structure which looked like a small factory."
HPL	"Joe Slater, who came to the institution in the vigilant custody of four state policemen, and who was described as a highly dangerous character, certainly presented no evidence of his perilous disposition when first I beheld him."
HPL	"As we drew nearer the green shore the bearded man told me of that land, the Land of Zar, where dwell all the dreams and thoughts of beauty that come to men once and then are forgotten."
HPL	Now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality.
HPL	"Within there were carven mantels and graceful stairs, and sensible, pleasing furniture, china, and silver, brought from the Mother Land."
HPL	"An' all the whiles he never see a thing, only them trees an' bushes a bendin'."
HPL	"I told them of the vault, and they pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed."
HPL	"Five of the worshippers lay dead, and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their fellow prisoners."
HPL	"There certainly is a strange kind of streak in the Innsmouth folks today I don't know how to explain it, but it sort of makes you crawl."
HPL	"He studied the timber and plaster walls for traces of cryptic designs at every accessible spot where the paper had peeled, and within a week managed to get the eastern attic room where Keziah was held to have practiced her spells."
HPL	"Birch, though dreading the bother of removal and interment, began his task of transference one disagreeable April morning, but ceased before noon because of a heavy rain that seemed to irritate his horse, after having laid but one mortal tenement to its permanent rest."
HPL	"Saving theirs, no eyes beheld the two divine figures released by skilful blows from the rough blocks that had imprisoned them since the world began."
HPL	From the medical and court documents we learned all that could be gathered of his case.
HPL	The victim had been seen alive considerably after midnight the dawn revealed the unutterable thing.
HPL	"This is probably true, but I have no distinct memory of it."
HPL	He had taken somewhat after his unknown father.
HPL	"""Cathuria,"" I would say to myself, ""is the abode of gods and the land of unnumbered cities of gold."
HPL	At last he woke in his bed in the crazily angled garret of the eldritch old house.
HPL	"""I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop's quickest by cuttin' acrost the lower medder here, wadin' the brook at the low place, an' climbin' through Carrier's mowin' and the timber lot beyont."
HPL	"We had devised two weapons to fight it; a large and specially fitted Crookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided with peculiar screens and reflectors, in case it proved intangible and opposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations, and a pair of military flame throwers of the sort used in the world war, in case it proved partly material and susceptible of mechanical destruction for like the superstitious Exeter rustics, we were prepared to burn the thing's heart out if heart existed to burn."
HPL	"Again the infinitude of the shrieking twilight abysses flashed past him, but in another second he thought he was in a dark, muddy, unknown alley of foetid odours, with the rotting walls of ancient houses towering up on every hand."
HPL	"There seemed to be a void, and nothing more, and I felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip pocket the revolver I always carried after dark since the night I was held up in East Providence."
HPL	"""Matt Eliot, his fust mate, talked a lot, too, only he was agin' folks's doin' any heathen things."
HPL	"Past the churchyard, where there were no houses, I could see over the hill's summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour, though the town was invisible in the dark."
HPL	"The small room seemed green with a dim aqueous light, and Olney saw that the far windows to the east were not open, but shut against the misty aether with dull thick panes like the bottoms of old bottles."
HPL	"The whole face finally began to grow tense, and the head turned restlessly with closed eyes."
HPL	"My slight fall had extinguished the lantern, but I produced an electric pocket lamp and viewed the small horizontal tunnel which led away indefinitely in both directions."
HPL	"Books and paintings and music came to the houses, and the young men went to the university which rose above the plain to the north."
HPL	"The jade amulet now reposed in a niche in our museum, and sometimes we burned strangely scented candles before it."
HPL	"Isolated among strange influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose day dreams and singular occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared."
HPL	"Then they vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue."
HPL	"Close by my home there lies a singular wooded hollow, in whose twilight deeps I spent most of my time; reading, thinking, and dreaming."
HPL	"There one might find the rotting, bald pates of famous noblemen, and the fresh and radiantly golden heads of new buried children."
HPL	Dr. West's reanimated specimens were not meant for long existence or a large audience.
HPL	"Far out beyond the breakwater was the dim, dark line of Devil Reef, and as I glimpsed it I could not help thinking of all the hideous legends I had heard in the last thirty four hours legends which portrayed this ragged rock as a veritable gateway to realms of unfathomed horror and inconceivable abnormality."
HPL	"This tribe, after destroying most of the edifices and killing the live beings, had carried off the stuffed goddess which had been the object of their quest; the white ape goddess which the strange beings worshipped, and which was held by Congo tradition to be the form of one who had reigned as a princess among those beings."
HPL	"And the gates of Sarnath were as many as the landward ends of the streets, each of bronze, and flanked by the figures of lions and elephants carven from some stone no longer known among men."
HPL	"I think you'd enjoy the pictures, for as I said, I've let myself go a bit there."
HPL	"Men have felt the tears of the gods on white capped Thurai, though they have thought it rain; and have heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive dawn winds of Lerion."
HPL	"All the strangeness and expectancy of his recent dreams seemed present in this hushed and unearthly landscape, and he thought of the unknown solitudes of other planets as his eyes traced out the velvet and deserted lawns shining undulant between their tumbled walls, the clumps of faery forest setting off far lines of purple hills beyond hills, and the spectral wooded valley dipping down in shadow to dank hollows where trickling waters crooned and gurgled among swollen and distorted roots."
HPL	"With whimpering insistence the squatters told tales of a daemon which seized lone wayfarers after dark, either carrying them off or leaving them in a frightful state of gnawed dismemberment; while sometimes they whispered of blood trails toward the distant mansion."
HPL	"Mr. Ricci and Mr. Silva were to interview the poor old gentleman, whilst Mr. Czanek waited for them and their presumable metallic burden with a covered motor car in Ship Street, by the gate in the tall rear wall of their host's grounds."
HPL	Gate o' hell sheer drop daown to a bottom no saoundin' line kin tech.
HPL	"And as the torches died out altogether, there remained above the stricken and shrieking cohort only the noxious and horrible altar flames on the towering peaks; hellish and red, and now silhouetting the mad, leaping, and colossal forms of such nameless beasts as had never a Phrygian priest or Campanian grandam whispered of in the wildest of furtive tales."
HPL	The sky was dark on the evening that the Tyrant's emissaries came to Tegea.
HPL	"I cannot even hint what it was like, for it was a compound of all that is unclean, uncanny, unwelcome, abnormal, and detestable."
HPL	"The officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased's living quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit."
HPL	Others snapped up what it left and ate with slavering relish.
HPL	"He was more than ordinarily tender hearted, and he did not like the hideous screams he had heard in the ancient house just after the hour appointed for the deed."
HPL	"His full name long and pompous according to the custom of an age which had lost the trinomial simplicity of classic Roman nomenclature is stated by Von Schweinkopf to have been Caius Anicius Magnus Furius Camillus Æmilianus Cornelius Valerius Pompeius Julius Ibidus; though Littlewit rejects Æmilianus and adds Claudius Decius Junianus; whilst Bêtenoir differs radically, giving the full name as Magnus Furius Camillus Aurelius Antoninus Flavius Anicius Petronius Valentinianus Aegidus Ibidus."
HPL	"Sailing for London, I reëmbarked at once for the Norwegian capital; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the Egeberg."
HPL	Sheets of music were piled in disorder about the floor.
HPL	"Then he would try to straighten up, and a certain fire would creep into the sunken eyes."
HPL	"But it was all right with the heathens, because they'd ben havin' a hard time an' was desp'rate abaout everything."
HPL	"Here he knew strange things had happened once, and there was a faint suggestion behind the surface that everything of that monstrous past might not at least in the darkest, narrowest, and most intricately crooked alleys have utterly perished."
HPL	"Besides I could not extract from my memory that hideous, inhuman shriek we heard on the night we tried our first experiment in the deserted farmhouse at Arkham."
HPL	"There was much in the Essex County records about Keziah Mason's trial, and what she had admitted under pressure to the Court of Oyer and Terminer had fascinated Gilman beyond all reason."
HPL	"Later I told Harris only through sheer necessity, and because he had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so little toward belief."
HPL	"We sware to one another that the city was exactly the same, and still alive; and when the electric lights began to fade we cursed the company over and over again, and laughed at the queer faces we made."
HPL	"Besides, the head of the institution had but lately warned me in his paternal way that I was overworking; that my mind needed a rest."
HPL	"I had somehow taken it for granted that the house was abandoned, yet as I approached it I was not so sure; for though the walks were indeed overgrown with weeds, they seemed to retain their nature a little too well to argue complete desertion."
HPL	"He made no explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan."
HPL	"And whether the sea was rough or calm, and whether the wind was friendly or adverse, it would always glide smoothly and silently, its sails distant and its long strange tiers of oars moving rhythmically."
HPL	"He wa'n't all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an' I think he an' Ol' Whateley must a raised suthin' in that there nailed up haouse as ain't even so human as he was."
HPL	"Anyhow, he manages to turn out results that differ from the pretender's mince pie dreams in just about the same way that the life painter's results differ from the concoctions of a correspondence school cartoonist."
HPL	"Witnesses said it had long hair and the shape of a rat, but that its sharp toothed, bearded face was evilly human while its paws were like tiny human hands."
HPL	"He smiled at this odd conceit, but it seemed that his smile was tinged with reminiscence."
HPL	them as had reel hands. . . .
HPL	"I was, it appeared, in very bad luck."
HPL	"The material seemed to be predominantly gold, though a weird lighter lustrousness hinted at some strange alloy with an equally beautiful and scarcely identifiable metal."
HPL	"What relation it had to the French ravings of Rhoby Harris and other inhabitants of the shunned house, imagination or future discovery alone could determine."
HPL	"But I did not pursue this course for more than a moment; for when the dumb musician recognised the whistled air his face grew suddenly distorted with an expression wholly beyond analysis, and his long, cold, bony right hand reached out to stop my mouth and silence the crude imitation."
HPL	"Green are the groves and pastures, bright and fragrant the flowers, blue and musical the streams, clear and cool the fountains, and stately and gorgeous the temples, castles, and cities of Sona Nyl."
HPL	"Atal was only the son of an innkeeper, and was sometimes afraid; but Barzai's father had been a landgrave who dwelt in an ancient castle, so he had no common superstition in his blood, and only laughed at the fearful cotters."
HPL	"Some houses along Main Street were tenanted, but most were tightly boarded up."
HPL	"They had to do with some preposterous legend of the bog, and of a grim guardian spirit that dwelt in the strange olden ruin on the far islet I had seen in the sunset."
HPL	"Before I had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable; now that he had evidently succeeded to some degree I almost shared his spirit, terrible though the cost of victory appeared."
HPL	"Rome and Ravenna are rivals for the honour of his birth, though it is certain that he received his rhetorical and philosophical training in the schools of Athens the extent of whose suppression by Theodosius a century before is grossly exaggerated by the superficial."
HPL	"West, young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements, had scant patience with good Dr. Halsey and his erudite colleagues; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion."
HPL	"In his brief conversation the stranger had made it clear that he was unknown in Bolton, and a search of his pockets subsequently revealed him to be one Robert Leavitt of St. Louis, apparently without a family to make instant inquiries about his disappearance."
HPL	"A few of the organic objects tended to awake vague memories in the back of his mind, though he could form no conscious idea of what they mockingly resembled or suggested."
HPL	"Now north of archaic Kingsport the crags climb lofty and curious, terrace on terrace, till the northernmost hangs in the sky like a grey frozen wind cloud."
HPL	That flopping or pattering was monstrous I could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it.
HPL	"He dared not disobey the summons for fear it might prove an illusion like the urges and aspirations of waking life, which do not lead to any goal."
HPL	"Let us go to Oonai, O Iranon of the golden head, where men shall know our longings and welcome us as brothers, nor ever laugh or frown at what we say."""
HPL	"It echoed and echoed through the dim vaultings of that ancient and nitrous cellar, and I had to choke back a flood of reaction that threatened to burst out as hysterical laughter."
HPL	"At length, feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it, I bolted the newly outfitted hall door, turned off the light, and threw myself down on the hard, uneven bed coat, collar, shoes, and all."
HPL	"Tucked obscurely away in a corner of the Arkham Advertiser was a facetious little item from the Associated Press, telling what a record breaking monster the bootleg whiskey of Dunwich had raised up."
HPL	"All he could do was moan half inaudibly, ""Oh, oh, great Gawd . . ."
HPL	"I repeat to you, gentlemen, that your inquisition is fruitless."
HPL	"I thought I was prepared for the worst, and I really ought to have been prepared considering what I had seen before."
HPL	"He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy; and my uncle shewed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archaeology."
HPL	He saw that his electric flashlight was in working order.
HPL	"I especially noted his new habit of muttering, for it was not like him to talk to himself."
HPL	"And the floor of the palace is of glass, under which flow the cunningly lighted waters of the Narg, gay with gaudy fish not known beyond the bounds of lovely Cathuria."""
HPL	"Half unconscious, I opened the grating and staggered out upon the white gravel path that stretched away in two directions."
HPL	"Those later spectral legends, I made plain, related to monstrous apparitions more frightful than anything organic could be; apparitions of gigantic bestial forms sometimes visible and sometimes only tangible, which floated about on moonless nights and haunted the old house, the crypt behind it, and the grave where a sapling had sprouted beside an illegible slab."
HPL	"Mostly we held to the theory that we were jointly going mad from our life of unnatural excitements, but sometimes it pleased us more to dramatise ourselves as the victims of some creeping and appalling doom."
HPL	But the looked for terror did not appear.
HPL	"It had at first been his hope to find a reagent which would restore vitality before the actual advent of death, and only repeated failures on animals had shewn him that the natural and artificial life motions were incompatible."
HPL	"I believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since August th; the daemon shadow in the mansion, the general strain and disappointment, and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an October storm."
HPL	"Its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing, and it soon came to be the greatest influence on the town, replacing Freemasonry altogether and taking up headquarters in the old Masonic Hall on New Church Green."
HPL	"Subtle Nature, convulsed with a spiritual ecstasy, like the froth of that region's quondam beverage, laid low the lofty and heaved high the humble and behold In the roseal dawn the burghers of Milwaukee rose to find a former prairie turned to a highland Vast and far reaching was the great upheaval."
HPL	"He clearly understood my needs at a glance, and ministered to them with a master's deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation."
HPL	"He had been found as a child in a crude mountain hut, the only survivor of an epidemic which had stalked lethally by."
HPL	"One of them, a heavy tome with an iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet this one of a very different cast, and resembling Sanscrit more than anything else."
HPL	"And the roof is of pure gold, set upon tall pillars of ruby and azure, and having such carven figures of gods and heroes that he who looks up to those heights seems to gaze upon the living Olympus."
HPL	"He might, he half jestingly said, some day teach me to live or at least to possess some kind of conscious existence without any heart at all For his part, he was afflicted with a complication of maladies requiring a very exact regimen which included constant cold."
HPL	"I do not know how long I gazed at this sight from the lonely turret window before I dropped suddenly in a dreamless swoon, out of which the high sun of morning aroused me."
HPL	"An old servant forced the carven lid, shaking as he did so at the hideous faces leering from the blackened wood, and at some unplaced familiarity."
HPL	"There had been soft talking, too and as he began to describe it his voice had sunk to an inaudible whisper."
HPL	The texture of the majority was a kind of unpleasant rubberiness.
HPL	"Behold, when I was small like thee I dwelt in the valley of Narthos by the frigid Xari, where none would listen to my dreams; and I told myself that when older I would go to Sinara on the southern slope, and sing to smiling dromedary men in the market place."
HPL	"For centuries its lofty battlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside about, serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose honoured line is older even than the moss grown castle walls."
HPL	"They did not see that good and evil and beauty and ugliness are only ornamental fruits of perspective, whose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made our fathers think and feel, and whose finer details are different for every race and culture."
HPL	"Nowhere, however, could he find ease and content; and as he grew older the staleness and limitations of life became more and more maddening to him."
HPL	"You men know that those Whateleys were wizards well, this thing is a thing of wizardry, and must be put down by the same means."
HPL	"Our couches were side by side, and we knew in a few seconds that we were in St. Mary's Hospital."
HPL	"Still too dazed to cry out, he plunged recklessly down the noisome staircase and into the mud outside; halting only when seized and choked by the waiting black man."
HPL	"Since most of my ancestors had been seized some little while before they reached the exact age of Comte Henri at his end, I was every moment on the watch for the coming of the unknown death."
HPL	"""What d'ye think o' this ain't never see the like hereabouts, eh?"
HPL	"The shadow I had seen, I hardly dared to analyse or identify."
HPL	"If heaven is merciful, it will some day efface from my consciousness the sight that I saw, and let me live my last years in peace."
HPL	"In another second I was alone in the accursed mansion, shivering and gibbering."
HPL	"The watery blue eyes were almost savage and maniacal now, and the dirty white beard bristled electrically."
HPL	"Many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his visitor, especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body."
HPL	It had been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing with the claw and eyes.
HPL	"The latter, he had said, was the daughter of a Portuguese trader whom he had met in Africa; and did not like English ways."
HPL	"Dazedness was uppermost, and I could scarcely recall what was dream and what was reality."
HPL	"We never even in our wildest Hallowe'en moods visited this cellar by night, but in some of our daytime visits could detect the phosphorescence, especially when the day was dark and wet."
HPL	"Extinguishing all lights, we proceeded to the door and threw it suddenly open; whereupon we felt an unaccountable rush of air, and heard as if receding far away a queer combination of rustling, tittering, and articulate chatter."
HPL	And toward the shore on the opposite bank of the river I saw the white belfry surmounting what I took to be the Marsh refinery.
HPL	Yog Sothoth is the gate.
HPL	"Once he met some friends who remarked how oddly sunburned he looked, but he did not tell them of his walk."
HPL	He used to make shuddering conjectures about the possible actions of a headless physician with the power of reanimating the dead.
HPL	"The old spinning woman had gone with the throng, and the old man remained only because I had refused when he motioned me to seize an animal and ride like the rest."
HPL	"Horrified, he had taken to the woods in a vague effort to escape from the scene of what must have been his crime."
HPL	"Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something and turned pale, nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep hollow that yawned close by."
HPL	"Physicians had told me of the danger of those spells, and I knew there was no time to be lost; so remembering what the landlady had said about the invalid's help of the injured workman, I dragged myself upstairs and knocked feebly at the door above mine."
HPL	"There was nothing I could say, because everything was wrong."
HPL	Yog Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate.
HPL	"As the doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again, ""But what, in God's name, can we do?"""
HPL	"I was like you once, and I did it."
HPL	"Then through the high mists he heard the voice of unseen Barzai shouting wildly in delight: ""I have heard the gods I have heard earth's gods singing in revelry on Hatheg Kla The voices of earth's gods are known to Barzai the Prophet The mists are thin and the moon is bright, and I shall see the gods dancing wildly on Hatheg Kla that they loved in youth The wisdom of Barzai hath made him greater than earth's gods, and against his will their spells and barriers are as naught; Barzai will behold the gods, the proud gods, the secret gods, the gods of earth who spurn the sight of men"" Atal could not hear the voices Barzai heard, but he was now close to the bulging cliff and scanning it for foot holds."
HPL	"I asked Esteban either to help with the ice fetching whilst I obtained the pump piston, or to order the piston while I continued with the ice; but instructed by his mother, he absolutely refused."
HPL	"Some time before noon his physician, Dr. Hartwell, called to see him and insisted that he cease work."
HPL	God knows how many there were there must have been thousands.
HPL	"They darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed."
HPL	"It was not the portrait of one whom an underworld denizen would be likely to know, but of a lady of breeding and quality, garbed in the quaint attire of thirty years before."
HPL	A Passer in the Storm For days after that hideous experience in the forest swathed mansion I lay nervously exhausted in my hotel room at Lefferts Corners.
HPL	"The rest had stuck sullenly to their ancestral mansion, becoming more and more clannish and taciturn, yet developing a nervous responsiveness to the frequent thunderstorms."
HPL	"I was no longer a young man, though but twenty one winters had chilled my bodily frame."
HPL	"He could not, of course, have locked the door behind him; yet it was now fastened, presumably from the inside."
HPL	Certainly the town was not London.
HPL	I had entered the brush grown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odour again waxed dominant.
HPL	"Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique wall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar."
HPL	"Windows in shanties on the slope outside were shattered by the shock, whilst miners throughout the nearer passages were knocked from their feet."
HPL	"Yet I did not hurry too precipitately, for there were architectural details worth viewing at every silent corner; and I could easily, I calculated, cover the necessary distance in a half hour."
HPL	"Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters, ""Cthulhu fhtagn""."
HPL	"His throat was aching inexplicably, and as he struggled to a sitting posture he saw with growing fright that his feet and pajama bottoms were brown with caked mud."
HPL	"Elwood will never forget it, and was forced to stay out of college the rest of the term because of the resulting nervous breakdown."
HPL	"Surely, I had little enough chance of rescue."
HPL	"Many times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I pause in the spectral half light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk, sometimes disclosing the mould stained stones of buried temples."
HPL	"Peasants had told them they were near, and Iranon knew that this was not his native city of Aira."
HPL	"This matter of the spectral piping harassed me greatly, and I wondered if the crickets of autumn had come before their time to vex the night and haunt the visions of men."
HPL	"His impassioned lectures in defence of Villon, , Verlaine, and Oscar Wilde were applied to himself as well, and in the short Indian summer of his glory there was talk of a renewed engagement at a certain cultured home on Park Avenue."
HPL	"As I thought of him new terrors convulsed me, and I fell to the floor; not fainting, but physically helpless."
HPL	"Pointing to a chair, table, and pile of books, the old man now left the room; and when I sat down to read I saw that the books were hoary and mouldy, and that they included old Morryster's wild Marvells of Science, the terrible Saducismus Triumphatus of Joseph Glanvill, published in , the shocking Daemonolatreia of Remigius, printed in at Lyons, and worst of all, the unmentionable Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, in Olaus Wormius' forbidden Latin translation; a book which I had never seen, but of which I had heard monstrous things whispered."
HPL	"Every shade of New England dialect, from the uncouth syllables of the Puritan colonists to the precise rhetoric of fifty years ago, seemed represented in that shadowy colloquy, though it was only later that I noticed the fact."
HPL	"Its forests are of aloe and sandalwood, even as the fragrant groves of Camorin, and among the trees flutter gay birds sweet with song."
HPL	"But now they have betaken themselves to unknown Kadath in the cold waste where no man treads, and are grown stern, having no higher peak whereto to flee at the coming of men."
HPL	"The Pequots, enfeebled by a previous war, could give the now stricken Narragansetts no assistance; and in a Dutch fur trader of Albany, Petrus van Schaack, secured the distinguished cranium for the modest sum of two guilders, he having recognised its value from the half effaced inscription carved in Lombardic minuscules palaeography, it might be explained, was one of the leading accomplishments of New Netherland fur traders of the seventeenth century."
HPL	"At once he saw there was something on the table which did not belong there, and a second look left no room for doubt."
HPL	"All this was flagrant trashiness, and my friend Manton was not slow to insist on that fact."
HPL	"By the fourth evening I attained the base of the mound, which turned out to be much higher than it had appeared from a distance; an intervening valley setting it out in sharper relief from the general surface."
HPL	"The baying was loud that evening, and in the morning I read of a nameless deed in the vilest quarter of the city."
HPL	"This bower was my temple, the fastened door my shrine, and here I would lie outstretched on the mossy ground, thinking strange thoughts and dreaming strange dreams."
HPL	Shapes talkin' sign language with their hands . . .
HPL	"It is not dream it is not, I fear, even madness for too much has already happened to give me these merciful doubts."
HPL	"From that time till his rescue on the th the man remembers little, and he does not even recall when William Briden, his companion, died."
HPL	"It was amply large enough for a man to wriggle through; and though no sane person would have tried it at that time, I forgot danger, reason, and cleanliness in my single minded fever to unearth the lurking fear."
HPL	Very little time had elapsed before I saw the attempt was not to be a total failure.
HPL	"Like and yet unlike, for there was in the eyes of all a weird, unhealthy glitter as of greed, ambition, vindictiveness, or misguided zeal."
HPL	"Mr. Garrick obtain'd Admittance only with Difficulty; for the Doctor, notwithstanding his great Friendship, was for ever affecting to decry the Stage and all Things connected with it."
HPL	"The clergymen or priests, or whatever they were called nowadays also wore this kind of ornament as a head dress; but one seldom caught glimpses of them."
HPL	"In the evening they drowsily discussed the mathematical studies which had so completely and perhaps harmfully engrossed Gilman, and speculated about the linkage with ancient magic and folklore which seemed so darkly probable."
HPL	"Being more than a little piqued at the Incivility of one whose Celebrity made me solicitous of his Approbation, I ventur'd to retaliate in kind, and told him, I was surpris'd that a Man of Sense shou'd judge the Thoughtfulness of one whose Productions he admitted never having read."
HPL	"""I'll tell you, I'm good and tired of water after reading of the merry bouts fellows used to have in the old days."
HPL	"Shrieking, slithering, torrential shadows of red viscous madness chasing one another through endless, ensanguined corridors of purple fulgurous sky . . ."
HPL	"There was no use trying to evade it, for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect."
HPL	"We had met years before, in medical school, and from the first I had shared his terrible researches."
HPL	"That bearded host seemed young, yet looked out of eyes steeped in the elder mysteries; and from the tales of marvellous ancient things he related, it must be guessed that the village folk were right in saying he had communed with the mists of the sea and the clouds of the sky ever since there was any village to watch his taciturn dwelling from the plain below."
HPL	"For some time I could not tell whether I was waking or sleeping, for the sound of flutes still rang shrilly in my ears; but when I saw on the floor the icy moonbeams and the outlines of a latticed Gothic window I decided I must be awake and in the castle at Kilderry."
HPL	"Almost dazed by this sudden obstacle, and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and half unlighted town, I left the bus and reëntered the hotel lobby; where the sullen, queer looking night clerk told me I could have Room on next the top floor large, but without running water for a dollar."
HPL	"He stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand; though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand, since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming."
HPL	"Early rising villagers who observed my homeward progress looked at me strangely, and marvelled at the signs of ribald revelry which they saw in one whose life was known to be sober and solitary."
HPL	"I will hint only hint that he had designs which involved the rulership of the visible universe and more; designs whereby the earth and the stars would move at his command, and the destinies of all living things be his."
HPL	High above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker re passed with snail like deliberateness.
HPL	"""Listen to me The waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping senses in us; senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the state of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity."
HPL	"The dreams were wholly beyond the pale of sanity, and Gilman felt that they must be a result, jointly, of his studies in mathematics and in folklore."
HPL	"Red tongues of flame and searing gusts of heat engulfed the house; and the roysterers, struck with terror at the descent of a calamity which seemed to transcend the bounds of unguided Nature, fled shrieking into the night."
HPL	"But my friend was in greater danger than I, and through my fear I felt a vague resentment that he should deem me capable of deserting him under such circumstances."
HPL	"But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness."
HPL	"They wondered, too, why the writers made so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date."
HPL	For that visitor was neither Italian nor policeman.
HPL	They were loud loud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoed yet did they come from no visible being.
HPL	"I remember seizing my revolver and hat, but before it was over I had lost them both without firing the one or donning the other."
HPL	"Gifted and learned, he took highest honours at Oxford and seemed likely to redeem the intellectual fame of his family."
HPL	"Geographically it lay about two miles northwest of the base of Tempest Mountain, and three miles from the oak girt mansion."
HPL	"But what frightened me most was that flaming column; spouting volcanically from depths profound and inconceivable, casting no shadows as healthy flame should, and coating the nitrous stone above with a nasty, venomous verdigris."
HPL	"""I've got a place that I don't believe three living Nordic men besides myself have ever seen."
HPL	"Klenze, though not my mental equal, was much better than no one."
HPL	"It was his twin brother, but it looked more like the father than he did."""
HPL	"It was in mid summer, when the alchemy of Nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous mass of green; when the senses are well nigh intoxicated with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable odours of the soil and the vegetation."
HPL	"Trever seemed dazed in the confusion, and shrank to the wall as the strife thickened."
HPL	"That, you remember, was when Minot cut him."
HPL	"What was the unknown island on which six of the Emma's crew had died, and about which the mate Johansen was so secretive?"
HPL	Gradually I came to find Herbert West himself more horrible than anything he did that was when it dawned on me that his once normal scientific zeal for prolonging life had subtly degenerated into a mere morbid and ghoulish curiosity and secret sense of charnel picturesqueness.
HPL	"They talked of the old cotter and his wife, of the caravan of dark wanderers, of small Menes and his black kitten, of the prayer of Menes and of the sky during that prayer, of the doings of the cats on the night the caravan left, and of what was later found in the cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yard."
HPL	"Without having any exact knowledge of geology, I had from the first been interested in the odd mounds and hummocks of the region."
HPL	When Randolph Carter was thirty he lost the key of the gate of dreams.
HPL	"He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great significance, and told the loungers at Osborn's that he thought his time had almost come."
HPL	"Then his fevered, abnormal hearing caught the distant, windborne notes."
HPL	"Beyond the Karthian hills lieth Oonai, the city of lutes and dancing, which men whisper of and say is both lovely and terrible."
HPL	"These figures were seldom completely human, but often approached humanity in varying degree."
HPL	"This chamber he lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to arrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms."
HPL	"Klenze and I usually slept at different times; and it was during my sleep, about A.M., July , that the general mutiny broke loose."
HPL	"Now, Eliot, I'm what the man in the street would call fairly ""hard boiled"", but I'll confess that what I saw on the walls of that room gave me a bad turn."
HPL	"For bringing the upper earth men's death I must do a penance, but that would not be heavy."
HPL	"Therefore instead of trying the door I knocked, feeling as I did so a trepidation I could scarcely explain."
HPL	"An' she says he says they was a swishin', lappin' saound, more nor what the bendin' trees an' bushes could make, an' all on a suddent the trees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side, an' they was a awful stompin' an' splashin' in the mud."
HPL	The more I studied them the more I wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them.
HPL	"I was eventually, I may add, almost cured of my disease for all time by his skilful ministrations."
HPL	"What we wanted were corpses interred soon after death and without artificial preservation; preferably free from malforming disease, and certainly with all organs present."
HPL	You know what he wants.
HPL	"The picture seared into my soul is of one scene only, and the hour must have been long after midnight; for a waning crescent moon was high in the vaporous heavens."
HPL	"The far corners were all shadows, and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm."
HPL	"He was not like any other Jermyn who had ever lived, for he was a poet and a dreamer."
HPL	"And far out at sea, despite a high tide, I glimpsed a long, black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy."
HPL	"A cry rose from the crowd, and Dr. Armitage shouted to the men outside that no one must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came."
HPL	"In every quarter, however, interest was intense; for the utter alienage of the thing was a tremendous challenge to scientific curiosity."
HPL	"But it would be well to say as little as could be said, and to let no other doctor treat the wounds."
HPL	Now it is told in the mouldy Pnakotic Manuscripts that Sansu found naught but wordless ice and rock when he climbed Hatheg Kla in the youth of the world.
HPL	"According to Mwanu, the grey city and the hybrid creatures were no more, having been annihilated by the warlike N'bangus many years ago."
HPL	"It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind."
HPL	"""Now if you're game, I'll take you there tonight."
HPL	"Human it could not have been it is not in man to make such sounds and without a thought of our late employment or its possible discovery both West and I leaped to the nearest window like stricken animals; overturning tubes, lamp, and retorts, and vaulting madly into the starred abyss of the rural night."
HPL	"Born on Candlemas nine months after May Eve of , when the talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to Arkham What walked on the mountains that May Night?"
HPL	"With this friend, Joel Manton, I had often languidly disputed."
HPL	"""The full moon damn ye ye . . ."
HPL	"Aira's beauty is past imagining, and none can tell of it without rapture, whilst of Oonai the camel drivers whisper leeringly."""
HPL	"There were many palaces, the least of which were mightier than any in Thraa or Ilarnek or Kadatheron."
HPL	"No one spoke to me, but I could hear the creaking of signs in the wind outside, and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old woman continued her silent spinning, spinning."
HPL	"Ahead raced the small, kaleidoscopic polyhedron, and all through the churning void there was a heightening and acceleration of the vague tonal pattern which seemed to foreshadow some unutterable and unendurable climax."
HPL	"On the contrary, she seemed strangely proud of the dark, goatish looking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pink eyed albinism, and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future."
HPL	"The year must have been in the late republic, for the province was still ruled by a senatorial proconsul instead of a prætorian legate of Augustus, and the day was the first before the Kalends of November."
HPL	At times I fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fish frogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil.
HPL	shots an' screams . . .
HPL	"We boys used to overrun the place, and I can still recall my youthful terror not only at the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation, but at the eldritch atmosphere and odour of the dilapidated house, whose unlocked front door was often entered in quest of shudders."
HPL	His gross body could not undergo the needed adjustments between ethereal life and planet life.
HPL	"He had chosen the place for purely symbolic and fantastically aesthetic reasons, since most of the interments were of the colonial period and therefore of little use to a scientist seeking very fresh bodies."
HPL	"Many were ill, but none made a disturbance."
HPL	People sometimes heard the queerest kind of sounds.
HPL	"When, in the end, my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked from my uncle the hoarded lore I sought, there lay before me a strange enough chronicle."
HPL	"It had been rather presumptuous of him to open the unlocked door after knocking had failed to rouse a response, but he had needed the help very badly and thought that his host would not mind a gentle prodding awake."
HPL	I was up in the cupalo . . .
HPL	"I found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge, and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information."
HPL	"I said it at first and I say it still, and I never swerved an inch, either, when he shewed that ""Ghoul Feeding""."
HPL	"As I emerged from an intervening grove upon the plain before the ruin, I beheld in the misty moonlight a thing I had always vaguely expected."
HPL	"It was captured by the private soldier Read 'em and Weep Hopkins, who not long after traded it to Rest in Jehovah Stubbs for a quid of new Virginia weed."
HPL	"As the particles struck the glassy surface at the centre of the strange device, they seemed to produce a crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube through which sparks are passed."
HPL	"I did not shriek, but all the fiendish ghouls that ride the night wind shrieked for me as in that same second there crashed down upon my mind a single and fleeting avalanche of soul annihilating memory."
HPL	"At first worshipped with dark rites by the prairie dogs, who saw in it a deity sent from the upper world, it afterward fell into dire neglect as the race of simple, artless burrowers succumbed before the onslaught of the conquering Aryan."
HPL	"Saddened by these family misfortunes, the scientist sought relief in work, and made two long expeditions in the interior of Africa."
HPL	"At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued."
HPL	Seems they was some of the things alive in the stone buildin's when the island come up sudden to the surface.
HPL	An increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around his apartment.
HPL	"The mansion, gone for a century, once more reared its stately height to the raptured vision; every window ablaze with the splendour of many candles."
HPL	"What I did there I may not say, for I am not now sure of the reality of certain things; but I know that on the day after such a nocturnal ramble I would often astonish those about me with my knowledge of topics almost forgotten for many generations."
HPL	Archaeologists and anthropologists are still trying to explain the bizarre designs chased on a crushed bowl of light metal whose inner side bore ominous brownish stains when found.
HPL	It was indeed in the place where I had seemed to see it.
HPL	"Then, as September approached, the clouds began to clear."
HPL	"The place is a remote, lonely elevation in that part of the Catskills where Dutch civilisation once feebly and transiently penetrated, leaving behind as it receded only a few ruined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting pitiful hamlets on isolated slopes."
HPL	It had ended horribly in a delirium of fear which we gradually came to attribute to our own overwrought nerves and West had never afterward been able to shake off a maddening sensation of being haunted and hunted.
HPL	"Once coming in a little the worse for Wine to which he was addicted he endeavour'd to lampoon me by means of an Impromptu in verse, writ on the Surface of the Table; but lacking the Aid he usually had in his Composition, he made a bad grammatical Blunder."
HPL	"I have examined maps of the city with the greatest care, yet have never again found the Rue d'Auseil."
HPL	"It was designed to open in my direction, hence I saw after drawing the bolt and finding other fastenings in place it was not a favourable one for forcing."
HPL	"He had, however, a great interest in antiquities; and proposed to explore the bog thoroughly when it was drained."
HPL	"It imparts an impression of terrible antiquity, as though it were the remotest rather than the immediate ancestor of Greek art."
HPL	"My friend said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings; that what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but Nyarlathotep dared prophesy, and that in the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had never been taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes."
HPL	"From the manner in which Slater alluded to their dealings, I judged that he and the luminous thing had met on equal terms; that in his dream existence the man was himself a luminous thing of the same race as his enemy."
HPL	"I had prized it greatly, yet nevertheless felt a sensation of relief at its disappearance."
HPL	West had never fully succeeded because he had never been able to secure a corpse sufficiently fresh.
HPL	"The nightmare was quick to come; for as I entered, there occurred immediately one of the most terrifying demonstrations I had ever conceived."
HPL	Nature is full of such illusions to impress the imaginative.
HPL	"There were no visible houses, and I could tell by the state of the road that traffic was very light hereabouts."
HPL	No tellin' what any o' them Kanakys will chance to git a holt of when the sea bottom throws up some island with ruins older'n the deluge.
HPL	"The old man would not live up to his aspect and manner, but would feign a smile and a light tone and prattle feverishly and frantically of cheerful trifles; his voice every moment rising and thickening till at last it would split in a piping and incoherent falsetto."
HPL	"So this was the way the folk of the uncanny house journeyed betwixt earth and sky When he climbed out of the chasm a morning mist was gathering, but he clearly saw the lofty and unhallowed cottage ahead; walls as grey as the rock, and high peak standing bold against the milky white of the seaward vapours."
HPL	"But my eyes were the keenest in the city, despite the long hours I gave each day to the study of the Pnakotic manuscripts and the wisdom of the Zobnarian Fathers; so my friend, desiring not to doom me to inaction, rewarded me with that duty which was second to nothing in importance."
HPL	"He was in the changeless, legend haunted city of Arkham, with its clustering gambrel roofs that sway and sag over attics where witches hid from the King's men in the dark, olden days of the Province."
HPL	"It seemed, in any event, to be contagious; for Hannah Bowen, one of the two servants, died of it in the following June."
HPL	"God, ef anybody'd look'd ahead . . ."
HPL	"When I saw this lore, I knew that it touched on the scenes I had haunted, and I therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus."
HPL	"As if beckoned by those who had gone before, I half floated between the titanic snowdrifts, quivering and afraid, into the sightless vortex of the unimaginable."
HPL	"As the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it began to mumble without turning or raising its head."
HPL	"After the first start, he replaced the tissue wrapping around the portrait, as if to shield it from the sordidness of the place."
HPL	"My frantic running ceased before I had covered a block, for at my left I began to hear something like the hue and cry of organised pursuit."
HPL	"The later action of the government, after my frantic appeals, would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth; but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasi hypnotic spell of that ancient, haunted, and shadowed town?"
HPL	"His great great great grandmother, he recalled, was said to have been the daughter of a Portuguese trader in Africa."
HPL	"He developed strange caprices, acquiring a fondness for exotic spices and Egyptian incense till his room smelled like the vault of a sepulchred Pharaoh in the Valley of Kings."
HPL	"This old man dwells all alone in a very ancient house on Water Street near the sea, and is reputed to be both exceedingly rich and exceedingly feeble; which forms a situation very attractive to men of the profession of Messrs. Ricci, Czanek, and Silva, for that profession was nothing less dignified than robbery."
HPL	"Great honours were then paid to the shades of those who had annihilated the odd ancient beings, and the memory of those beings and of their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses from the gardens of Zokkar."
HPL	"What if I told you that I've got another studio up there, where I can catch the night spirit of antique horror and paint things that I couldn't even think of in Newbury Street?"
HPL	"Wise men told him his simple fancies were inane and childish, and he believed it because he could see that they might easily be so."
HPL	My rather original ideas regarding life and death had caused me to associate the cold clay with the breathing body in a vague fashion; and I felt that the great and sinister family of the burned down mansion was in some way represented within the stone space I sought to explore.
HPL	"About seven o'clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at George Corey's, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten Acre Meadow with the cows."
HPL	"The vault to which I refer is of ancient granite, weathered and discoloured by the mists and dampness of generations."
HPL	"Dark, frail, and somewhat unkempt in aspect, he turned languidly at my knock and asked me my business without rising."
HPL	From even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent.
HPL	"Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its conservatism, had found him quite hopeless."
HPL	It had been a vigorous man; a well dressed stranger just off the train on his way to transact some business with the Bolton Worsted Mills.
HPL	"Those haunting notes I had remembered, and had often hummed and whistled inaccurately to myself; so when the player at length laid down his bow I asked him if he would render some of them."
HPL	"Physicians were unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for the end."
HPL	It was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon me the impression which destroyed my last vestige of self control and set me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street.
HPL	"He had better, he thought, sprinkle flour within the room as well as outside the door though after all no further proof of his sleep walking was needed."
HPL	"Arter I got the book off Eb I uster look at it a lot, especial when I'd heerd Passon Clark rant o' Sundays in his big wig."
HPL	"What with this an' that, he didn't git to sleep at all till sunup, an' no sooner was he up this mornin', but he's got to go over to Whateley's an' see what's the matter."
HPL	His mother seems to've ben some kind of foreigner they say a South Sea islander so everybody raised Cain when he married an Ipswich girl fifty years ago.
HPL	"And when my knock was answered I was fully afraid, because I had not heard any footsteps before the door creaked open."
HPL	"Determined upon further exploration, I felt in my pockets for flint and steel, and lit the unused torch which I had with me."
HPL	"Professor Angell, as befitted one of his authority and attainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was one of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution."
HPL	"I had already decided not to abandon the quest for the lurking fear, for in my rash ignorance it seemed to me that uncertainty was worse than enlightenment, however terrible the latter might prove to be."
HPL	"Nothing that I could have imagined nothing, even, that I could have gathered had I credited old Zadok's crazy tale in the most literal way would be in any way comparable to the daemoniac, blasphemous reality that I saw or believe I saw."
HPL	"I am Basil Elton, keeper of the North Point light that my father and grandfather kept before me."
HPL	Too many folks missin' too much wild preachin' at meetin' of a Sunday too much talk abaout that reef.
HPL	And a violet coloured gas told him that this part of space was outside what he had called infinity.
HPL	"Especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining, and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein."
HPL	"So, after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man."
HPL	Who can be sure of reality after hearing things like the tale of old Zadok Allen?
HPL	"In that palace there were also many galleries, and many amphitheatres where lions and men and elephants battled at the pleasure of the kings."
HPL	"All denied a part in the ritual murders, and averred that the killing had been done by Black Winged Ones which had come to them from their immemorial meeting place in the haunted wood."
HPL	"Into this the grimacing crone started, dragging Gilman after her by his pajama sleeve."
HPL	What I saw in the glow of my flashlight after I shot the unspeakable straggling object was so simple that almost a minute elapsed before I understood and went delirious.
HPL	"Again I called down, ""Warren, are you there?"", and in answer heard the thing which has brought this cloud over my mind."
HPL	"Rain had long effaced any possible footprints, though Boston investigators had something to say about evidences of disturbances among the fallen timbers of the Carter place."
HPL	The dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear numbed family.
HPL	"Reference to this object, the doctor added, was invariably a prelude to the young man's subsidence into lethargy."
HPL	"Most were seamen, and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes, largely West Indians or Brava Portuguese from the Cape Verde Islands, gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult."
HPL	It would perhaps have been easier to keep my thoughts from disturbing topics had the room not been so gruesomely musty.
HPL	"His mind was not Prussian, but given to imaginings and speculations which have no value."
HPL	A second reflection was less comforting.
HPL	"Small Romnod was now not so small, and spoke deeply instead of shrilly, though Iranon was always the same, and decked his golden hair with vines and fragrant resins found in the woods."
HPL	"Then came the devastating stroke of lightning which shook the whole mountain, lit the darkest crypts of the hoary grove, and splintered the patriarch of the twisted trees."
HPL	"The Essex County histories on the library shelves had very little to say, except that the town was founded in , noted for shipbuilding before the Revolution, a seat of great marine prosperity in the early nineteenth century, and later a minor factory centre using the Manuxet as power."
HPL	"At the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age, squalor, and dilapidation."
HPL	At last I saw the ancient arcaded station or what was left of it and made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end.
HPL	"We retired about eleven, but I did not sleep well."
HPL	"One summer night, after a thunderstorm of unprecedented violence, the countryside was aroused by a squatter stampede which no mere delusion could create."
HPL	"We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far."
HPL	"The old man's whisper grew fainter, and I found myself shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation, even though I knew his tale could be nothing but drunken phantasy."
HPL	"Perhaps it was at first only the manifest reluctance of my old preceptor to discuss with me my paternal ancestry that gave rise to the terror which I ever felt at the mention of my great house; yet as I grew out of childhood, I was able to piece together disconnected fragments of discourse, let slip from the unwilling tongue which had begun to falter in approaching senility, that had a sort of relation to a certain circumstance which I had always deemed strange, but which now became dimly terrible."
HPL	"Barnabas Marsh that runs the refin'ry naow is Obed's grandson by his fust wife son of Onesiphorus, his eldest son, but his mother was another o' them as wa'n't never seed aoutdoors."
HPL	Ordinarily he was true to the derelict type ready to do anything for a nickel or a dose of whiskey or hasheesh but at rare intervals he shewed the traits which earned him his name.
HPL	"Only greater maturity could help him understand the chronic mental limitations of the ""professor doctor"" type the product of generations of pathetic Puritanism; kindly, conscientious, and sometimes gentle and amiable, yet always narrow, intolerant, custom ridden, and lacking in perspective."
HPL	It seemed to me that there were limitless swarms of them and certainly my momentary glimpse could have shewn only the least fraction.
HPL	"""I'm sorry to have to ask you to stay on the surface,"" he said, ""but it would be a crime to let anyone with your frail nerves go down there."
HPL	"The tread was heavy, yet seemed to contain a curious quality of cautiousness; a quality which I disliked the more because the tread was heavy."
HPL	The only substantial disappointment encountered in this site was that which concerned the prevalence of violent thunderstorms in summer.
HPL	Only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by Legrasse's men as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and the muffled tom toms.
HPL	"Undisturbed by oppressive reflections on the time, the place, and the company beneath his feet, he philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork; cursing when a fragment hit him in the face, and laughing when one struck the increasingly excited horse that pawed near the cypress tree."
HPL	"And swarming loathsomely on aërial galleries I saw the yellow, squint eyed people of that city, robed horribly in orange and red, and dancing insanely to the pounding of fevered kettle drums, the clatter of obscene crotala, and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose ceaseless dirges rose and fell undulantly like the waves of an unhallowed ocean of bitumen."
HPL	Nothing new rewarded my efforts only the same depressing mustiness and faint suggestions of noxious odours and nitrous outlines on the floor and I fancy that many pedestrians must have watched me curiously through the broken panes.
HPL	"The coroner's physician decided that some belonged to a small child, while certain others found mixed with shreds of rotten brownish cloth belonged to a rather undersized, bent female of advanced years."
HPL	"And now for the first time my memory records verbal discourse, Warren addressing me at length in his mellow tenor voice; a voice singularly unperturbed by our awesome surroundings."
HPL	"Scores of rabbits and guinea pigs had been killed and treated, but their trail was a blind one."
HPL	As to the nature of our studies must I say again that I no longer retain full comprehension?
HPL	"""But I am Iranon, a singer of songs,"" he said, ""and have no heart for the cobbler's trade."""
HPL	"Far gone, was Obed . . ."
HPL	"Maddened by the sound, or by the stench which billowed forth even to the open air, the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for a neigh, and plunged madly off through the night, the wagon rattling crazily behind it."
HPL	"Another filed down a weed choked subway entrance, howling with a laughter that was mad."
HPL	"For myself I was proud, knowing how the Fatherland would revere my memory and how my sons would be taught to be men like me."
HPL	"Mazurewicz was waiting for him at the door, and seemed both anxious and reluctant to whisper some fresh bit of superstition."
HPL	Amidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest Carter tried to live as befitted a man of keen thought and good heritage.
HPL	At the same moment the disgusting form of Brown Jenkin scrambled up over the brink of the triangular black gulf on his left.
HPL	"The light was dim, but Birch's sight was good, and he did not get Asaph Sawyer's coffin by mistake, although it was very similar."
HPL	"Perhaps he did not know, or perhaps he knew and did not dare to tell."
HPL	"Collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline, above which rose the ghoulish, decapitated steeple of an ancient church."
HPL	"Looking upward he saw three stupendous discs of flame, each of a different hue, and at a different height above an infinitely distant curving horizon of low mountains."
HPL	The old deserted Chapman house had inexplicably burned to an amorphous heap of ashes; that we could understand because of the upset lamp.
HPL	"Advancing to one of these I looked in and saw an oddly dressed company, indeed; making merry, and speaking brightly to one another."
HPL	"He will, I believe, some time be heard from as one of the great decadents; for he has crystallised in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which Arthur Machen evokes in prose, and Clark Ashton Smith makes visible in verse and in painting."
HPL	"It is not known how long Iranon tarried in Oonai, but one day the King brought to the palace some wild whirling dancers from the Liranian desert, and dusky flute players from Drinen in the East, and after that the revellers threw their roses not so much at Iranon as at the dancers and the flute players."
HPL	"The clatter at the northerly connecting door was now terrific, and I saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter."
HPL	Gorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the destroying of Ib.
HPL	"They have come to form a race by themselves, with the well defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding."
HPL	"After a while there was utter blackness, and then the light of myriad stars forming strange, alien constellations."
HPL	"Old Scribonius himself looked very grave, and the sharp voices of us later comers seemed to hold something of curious inappropriateness, as in a place of death or the temple of some mystic god."
HPL	When he did so his cry was less restrained than Morgan's had been.
HPL	"His wilder wanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that something in a boarded up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension."
HPL	"Again he tried to stop up the hole at the base of the slanting wall, wedging in a candlestick which seemed of about the right size."
HPL	"Sometimes a lone poet or traveller would come to view them, and would try to picture them in their vanished glory; yet of such travellers and poets there were not many."
HPL	"From its machicolated parapets and mounted battlements Barons, Counts, and even Kings had been defied, yet never had its spacious halls resounded to the footsteps of the invader."
HPL	"Jewel Lake, which lay above the scene of action, heaved as in a tempest."
HPL	"It was the Yuletide, that men call Christmas though they know in their hearts it is older than Bethlehem and Babylon, older than Memphis and mankind."
HPL	"At this point I was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of all, how the curse had been fulfilled since that time when Charles Le Sorcier must in the course of Nature have died, for the man digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards, father and son, speaking most particularly of the researches of Charles Le Sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook of it eternal life and youth."
HPL	This fusion of dream and reality was too much to bear.
HPL	Strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from secure places of storage; and diagrams and formulae were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance.
HPL	"Ef they dew, they'll keep up a singin' an' laffin' till break o' day."
HPL	"In this twilight, too, he began to realise the truth and to shout loudly as if his horse outside could do more than neigh an unsympathetic reply."
HPL	From such books I learned all that I know.
HPL	"Other and later Members of the CLUB were Mr. David Garrick, the Actor and early Friend of Dr. Johnson, Messieurs Tho. and Jos."
HPL	And the traveller declares that instead of the place's wonted stench there lingered a delicate fragrance as of roses in full bloom.
HPL	At the end of the cut it would cross the track and swerve off to a safer distance; but meanwhile I must be exceedingly careful.
HPL	"In ten minutes my mind was made up, and taking my hat I set out for home, where I bathed, ate, and gave by telephone an order for a pickaxe, a spade, a military gas mask, and six carboys of sulphuric acid, all to be delivered the next morning at the cellar door of the shunned house in Benefit Street."
HPL	"Hey? Heh, heh, heh, heh. . . ."
HPL	"He was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of Yog Sothoth in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him."
HPL	"He laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder, and it seemed to me that its shaking was not altogether that of mirth."
HPL	It might mean the end of all our local work and perhaps prison for both West and me.
HPL	"In the end the three men from Arkham old, white bearded Dr. Armitage, stocky, iron grey Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr. Morgan ascended the mountain alone."
HPL	"But the flabby hands, curiously gloved, wrote genially on the tablet and told me I must wait a while before I could be led to the place of festival."
HPL	"The task seemed interminable, and I raged almost as violently as the hermit when I saw the hours slipping by in a breathless, foodless round of vain telephoning, and a hectic quest from place to place, hither and thither by subway and surface car."
HPL	"One of these things which excited several Miskatonic professors profoundly is a badly damaged monstrosity plainly resembling the strange image which Gilman gave to the college museum, save that it is larger, wrought of some peculiar bluish stone instead of metal, and possessed of a singularly angled pedestal with undecipherable hieroglyphics."
HPL	"In his experiments with various animating solutions he had killed and treated immense numbers of rabbits, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, and monkeys, till he had become the prime nuisance of the college."
HPL	"Then he saw the fanged, bearded little face in the rat hole the accursed little face which he at last realised bore such a shocking, mocking resemblance to old Keziah's and heard the faint fumbling at the door."
HPL	"""Folks aoutside hev their stories abaout us s'pose you've heerd a plenty on 'em, seein' what questions ye ast stories abaout things they've seed naow an' then, an' abaout that queer joolry as still comes in from somewhars an' ain't quite all melted up but nothin' never gits def'nite."
HPL	"Water Street was almost its duplicate, save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been."
HPL	"When I see this I telled Eb Holt, 'That's suthin' ta stir ye up an' make yer blood tickle' When I read in Scripter about slayin' like them Midianites was slew I kinder think things, but I ain't got no picter of it."
HPL	Only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know.
HPL	"Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat brighter than before, and the crowd fancied that it had shewed a certain mistiness around the altar stone on the distant height."
HPL	"I turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted, so rising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed the light to see if he seemed in any pain."
HPL	"Many of the crowded family degenerated, moved across the valley, and merged with the mongrel population which was later to produce the pitiful squatters."
HPL	"But in Kingsport strange tales are abroad, and even the Terrible Old Man admits a thing untold by his grandfather."
HPL	But so long as we don't move we're fairly safe.
HPL	"Who or what then, was my great great grandmother?"
HPL	"Their waving translucent arms, guided by the detestable piping of those unseen flutes, beckoned in uncanny rhythm to a throng of lurching labourers who followed dog like with blind, brainless, floundering steps as if dragged by a clumsy but resistless daemon will."
HPL	"I watched from midnight to one o'clock, when in spite of the sinister house, the unprotected window, and the approaching thunder and lightning, I felt singularly drowsy."
HPL	As they reached the broad open space where I had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water I could see them plainly only a block away and was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the dog like sub humanness of their crouching gait.
HPL	"In this year the servant Mehitabel died, and the other servant, Preserved Smith, left without coherent explanation or at least, with only some wild tales and a complaint that he disliked the smell of the place."
HPL	"""I tell ye, Mis' Corey, they's suthin' abroad as hadn't orter be abroad, an' I for one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to the bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin' of it."
HPL	"His clothing was badly rumpled, and Joe's crucifix was missing."
HPL	"The landlady, a slatternly, almost bearded Spanish woman named Herrero, did not annoy me with gossip or with criticisms of the late burning electric light in my third floor front hall room; and my fellow lodgers were as quiet and uncommunicative as one might desire, being mostly Spaniards a little above the coarsest and crudest grade."
HPL	That same night saw the beginning of the second Arkham horror the horror that to me eclipsed the plague itself.
HPL	"I, however, who seemed to be a close friend of Balbutius, had disagreed with him; averring that I had studied deeply in the black forbidden lore, and that I believed the very old folk capable of visiting almost any nameless doom upon the town, which after all was a Roman settlement and contained a great number of our citizens."
HPL	"He could distinguish no words, yet the tone was haunting and unmistakable."
HPL	It is well that no explanation shall ever reach them.
HPL	"Manton seemed unimpressed by my arguments, and eager to refute them, having that confidence in his own opinions which had doubtless caused his success as a teacher; whilst I was too sure of my ground to fear defeat."
HPL	"Wilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr. Dee's English version which his grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon receiving access to the Latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have come on the st page of his own defective volume."
HPL	Now he felt that he must go north infinitely north.
HPL	"I now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me till I, too, am at rest; ""accidentally"" or otherwise."
HPL	"I bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter, and thought I saw a sardonic smile behind the stained, bushy whiskers."
HPL	"In frame he was small, but intensely powerful, and was of incredible agility."
HPL	"""Don't move,"" he cautioned, ""for in these rays we are able to be seen as well as to see."
HPL	"The place had dispirited me curiously that evening, and I was almost prepared when I saw or thought I saw amidst the whitish deposits a particularly sharp definition of the ""huddled form"" I had suspected from boyhood."
HPL	"I can recall the scene in these final moments the pale autumnal moon over the graves, casting long horrible shadows; the grotesque trees, drooping sullenly to meet the neglected grass and the crumbling slabs; the vast legions of strangely colossal bats that flew against the moon; the antique ivied church pointing a huge spectral finger at the livid sky; the phosphorescent insects that danced like death fires under the yews in a distant corner; the odours of mould, vegetation, and less explicable things that mingled feebly with the night wind from over far swamps and seas; and worst of all, the faint deep toned baying of some gigantic hound which we could neither see nor definitely place."
HPL	"Opposite the large window was an enormous Dutch fireplace with scriptural tiles representing the prodigal son, and opposite the narrow window was a spacious bed built into the wall."
HPL	"After the beams came clouds, and then I slept."
HPL	"I hed two er three schoolmasters read me a bit, and Passon Clark, him they say got draownded in the pond kin yew make anything outen it?"""
HPL	"Results, I am certain, are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified raiders at Innsmouth."
HPL	In this fearless explorer had been placed in a madhouse at Huntingdon.
HPL	Thet feller bein' chopped up gives me a tickle every time I look at 'im I hev ta keep lookin' at 'im see whar the butcher cut off his feet?
HPL	"Also, I must not dwell on what that factory inspector had told the Newburyport ticket agent about the Gilman House and the voices of its nocturnal tenants not on that, nor on the face beneath the tiara in the black church doorway; the face for whose horror my conscious mind could not account."
HPL	"Then came a halt in the gasping, and the dog raised its head in a long, lugubrious howl."
HPL	"I retired early and full of dread, and for a long time could not sleep in the uncanny silence of the tower."
HPL	"Speechless, I could only wait."
HPL	"Well, Eliot, that was the end of the night's adventure."
HPL	The disordered earth was covered with blood and human debris bespeaking too vividly the ravages of daemon teeth and talons; yet no visible trail led away from the carnage.
HPL	"Around the middle of July just a year after the Innsmouth experience I spent a week with my late mother's family in Cleveland; checking some of my new genealogical data with the various notes, traditions, and bits of heirloom material in existence there, and seeing what kind of connected chart I could construct."
HPL	"There was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of poor Curtis Whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so that he put his hands to his head with a moan."
HPL	But all this vanished in a second.
HPL	Within twenty four hours that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognised sense organs that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges.
HPL	But what threw Gilman into a cold perspiration was the report of a pair of revellers who had been walking past the mouth of the gangway just after midnight.
HPL	"After he went to Ireland Barry wrote me often, and told me how under his care the grey castle was rising tower by tower to its ancient splendour; how the ivy was climbing slowly over the restored walls as it had climbed so many centuries ago, and how the peasants blessed him for bringing back the old days with his gold from over the sea."
HPL	"I saw the Alert, now sold and in commercial use, at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, but gained nothing from its non committal bulk."
HPL	I am not even certain how I am communicating this message.
HPL	Only these nothing more.
HPL	"When Jermyn sailed for England, therefore, it was with the exultant probability that he would within a few months receive a priceless ethnological relic confirming the wildest of his great great great grandfather's narratives that is, the wildest which he had ever heard."
HPL	"The chanting of the men from Arkham now became unmistakable, and Wheeler saw through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation."
HPL	"What he wanted was not a thing which many persons want, but something connected with the peculiar branch of medical science which he had chosen quite clandestinely to follow, and in which he had achieved amazing and occasionally hideous results."
HPL	"Guided by a lightning flash I settled myself down behind a dense clump of vegetation, through which I could see the opening without being seen."
HPL	"I did not wholly disagree with him theoretically, yet held vague instinctive remnants of the primitive faith of my forefathers; so that I could not help eyeing the corpse with a certain amount of awe and terrible expectation."
HPL	"That night I passed the gateway to a vortex of twisted time and vision, and when morning found me in the attic room I saw in the walls and shelves and fittings that which I had never seen before."
HPL	It would help my shaky nerves if I could dismiss what I now have to think of the air and the sky about and above me.
HPL	"He had a narrow head, bulging, watery blue eyes that seemed never to wink, a flat nose, a receding forehead and chin, and singularly undeveloped ears."
HPL	"The door resisted even more than I had expected, but I did not give in."
HPL	"His clutch relaxed, and as he saw my disgust and offence his own anger seemed to subside."
HPL	"After I saw that he was no longer in the boat I threw the searchlight around the water in an effort to obtain a last glimpse of him; since I wished to ascertain whether the water pressure would flatten him as it theoretically should, or whether the body would be unaffected, like those extraordinary dolphins."
HPL	"Finally I was sure it was not a face at all, but a fiendishly cunning mask."
HPL	"The bolt held, of course, and I heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room."
HPL	"I alone remained, riveted to my seat by a grovelling fear which I had never felt before."
HPL	"He did not try to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his soul."
HPL	"I had first Knowledge of the Doctor in May of the year , tho' I did not at that Time meet him."
HPL	"On the third morning of the wanderers' stay in Ulthar, Menes could not find his kitten; and as he sobbed aloud in the market place certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife, and of sounds heard in the night."
HPL	"The squire who succeeded to it in studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries, all connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground, and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding."
HPL	"Sir John, an eccentrick Fellow, once declin'd to pay his part of the Reckoning for Supper, because 'twas his Custom at Home to eat no Supper."
HPL	"After a pause, during which the flock of whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he added another sentence or two."
HPL	"The country bore an aspect more than usually sinister as we viewed it by night and without the accustomed crowds of investigators, so that we were often tempted to use the acetylene headlight despite the attention it might attract."
HPL	From somewhere within the works a dog barked in answer; either to the coyote or to something else.
HPL	"When selecting the hill and building his mansion, Mynheer Martense had laid these frequent natural outbursts to some peculiarity of the year; but in time he perceived that the locality was especially liable to such phenomena."
HPL	"And if ye toil only that ye may toil more, when shall happiness find you?"
HPL	"Picking up my pack, I started for the crest of the eminence."
HPL	"You know, the curled up paper tacked to that frightful canvas in the cellar; the thing I thought was a photograph of some scene he meant to use as a background for that monster."
HPL	"So, too, as we sailed the next day away from Holland to our home, we thought we heard the faint distant baying of some gigantic hound in the background."
HPL	"""Dun't believe me, hey?"
HPL	At this juncture the shutter began to rattle in a howling night wind which had sprung up outside as if in answer to the mad playing within.
HPL	"It was a simple, rambling thing a naive sailor's effort at a post facto diary and strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage."
HPL	"So liberal, indeed, was the discipline of our captors, that five days after we were taken I managed to escape alone in a small boat with water and provisions for a good length of time."
HPL	"Great watery spaces opened out before me, and I seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy Cyclopean walls with grotesque fishes as my companions."
HPL	They had traded the false gods of fear and blind piety for those of licence and anarchy.
HPL	"Well that paper wasn't a photograph of any background, after all."
HPL	"The great house was very still, for I had not gone up till after midnight."
HPL	"No sane person had even seen it, and few had ever felt it definitely."
HPL	"Groups of citizens broad browed Roman colonists and coarse haired Romanised natives, together with obvious hybrids of the two strains, alike clad in cheap woollen togas and sprinklings of helmeted legionaries and coarse mantled, black bearded tribesmen of the circumambient Vascones all thronged the few paved streets and forum; moved by some vague and ill defined uneasiness."
HPL	"I recall him to have worn a bushy Bob Wig, untyed and without Powder, and much too small for his Head."
HPL	"Fish Street was as deserted as Main, though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape."
HPL	"All of these, however, bore out the notes in full."
HPL	"My attitude was still one of absolute materialism, as I wish it still were, and I discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by Professor Angell."
HPL	"The old Captain's ben dead these sixty years, and there ain't ben a good sized ship out of the place since the Civil War; but just the same the Marshes still keep on buying a few of those native trade things mostly glass and rubber gewgaws, they tell me."
HPL	Then as I heard another crash I opened my eyes and beheld myself upon the platform of that lighthouse from whence I had sailed so many aeons ago.
HPL	"But I saw the dimness was only that of contrast, and that the waves from the machine had no effect whatever."
HPL	"I could not, I decided, risk an emergence into the corridor; where my footsteps would surely be heard, and where the difficulties of entering the desired room would be insuperable."
HPL	"But not many flags floated over The Street, for therein brooded only fear and hatred and ignorance."
HPL	"A kind of growing horror, of outré and morbid cast, seemed to possess him."
HPL	"And shadowed on a screen, I saw hooded forms amidst ruins, and yellow evil faces peering from behind fallen monuments."
HPL	"It was very dark, for although the sky was clear the moon was now well in the wane, and would not rise till the small hours."
HPL	"Ugh I can see them now Their occupations well, don't ask me to be too precise."
HPL	Queer how the fish swarm right there and nowhere else.
HPL	"Our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few, and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow."
HPL	"He guessed it was in the attic at home in Boston, and dimly remembered bribing Parks with half his week's allowance to help him open the box and keep quiet about it; but when he remembered this, the face of Parks came up very strangely, as if the wrinkles of long years had fallen upon the brisk little Cockney."
HPL	"However, he never openly fell out with the Doctor, and was the Executor of his Will; tho' Mr. Boswell and others have Reason to question the genuineness of his Attachment."
HPL	"He was barefooted and in his night clothes, and when he tried to walk discovered that he could scarcely lift his feet."
HPL	"""Wal, Sir, Obed he larnt that they's things on this arth as most folks never heerd abaout an' wouldn't believe ef they did hear."
HPL	"As Slater grew older, it appeared, his matutinal aberrations had gradually increased in frequency and violence; till about a month before his arrival at the institution had occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the authorities."
HPL	"Gad, I wouldn't be alive if I'd ever seen what that man if he was a man saw You recall that Pickman's forte was faces."
HPL	Was he going mad? How long would it last?
HPL	"Some power from heaven, coming to my aid, obliterated both sights and sounds in such a crash as may be heard when two universes collide in space."
HPL	"I knew not who I was or what I was, or what my surroundings might be; though as I continued to stumble along I became conscious of a kind of fearsome latent memory that made my progress not wholly fortuitous."
HPL	"That was Darius Peck, the nonagenarian, whose grave was not far from the tomb."
HPL	"Warton, Dr. Adam Smith, Dr. Percy, Author of the ""Reliques"", Mr. Edw."
HPL	"I had been on a long visit to my parents in Illinois, and upon my return found West in a state of singular elation."
HPL	"We even avoid looking at it very steadily."""
HPL	great bulgin' eyes all over it . . .
HPL	The peak of the epidemic was reached in August.
HPL	"The town, I could see, formed a significant and exaggerated example of communal decay; but being no sociologist I would limit my serious observations to the field of architecture."
HPL	"They were the blasphemous fish frogs of the nameless design living and horrible and as I saw them I knew also of what that humped, tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me."
HPL	But at last I am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing.
HPL	"He has never seen Kingsport again, for his family disliked the funny old houses, and complained that the drains were impossibly bad."
HPL	"Sheehan, now recovering from his astonishment, advanced and laid a heavy hand on the old waif's shoulder."
HPL	"One morning at breakfast I came close to disaster by declaiming in palpably liquorish accents an effusion of eighteenth century Bacchanalian mirth; a bit of Georgian playfulness never recorded in a book, which ran something like this: Come hither, my lads, with your tankards of ale, And drink to the present before it shall fail; Pile each on your platter a mountain of beef, For 'tis eating and drinking that bring us relief: So fill up your glass, For life will soon pass; When you're dead ye'll ne'er drink to your king or your lass Anacreon had a red nose, so they say; But what's a red nose if ye're happy and gay?"
HPL	"As it was, we hoped desperately that the storm would last until well after dark; and with that hope turned from our aimless hillside searching toward the nearest inhabited hamlet to gather a body of squatters as helpers in the investigation."
HPL	"He did not know where he wished to go, but felt that once more he would have to sacrifice his classes."
HPL	"I had largely given over my inquiries into what Professor Angell called the ""Cthulhu Cult"", and was visiting a learned friend in Paterson, New Jersey; the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note."
HPL	"My watch was still going, and told me that the hour was past noon."
HPL	"I returned to the boat as my electric batteries grew feeble, resolved to explore the rock temple on the following day."
HPL	"""You ought to hear, though, what some of the old timers tell about the black reef off the coast Devil Reef, they call it."
HPL	"At that time a party made investigations, finding the house deserted and partly in ruins."
HPL	"Our lanterns disclosed the top of a flight of stone steps, dripping with some detestable ichor of the inner earth, and bordered by moist walls encrusted with nitre."
HPL	"When we gazed around the horizon, we could not find the third tower by the river, and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the top."
HPL	"In subsequent decades as new inventions, new names, and new events appeared one by one in the book of history, people would now and then recall wonderingly how Carter had years before let fall some careless word of undoubted connexion with what was then far in the future."
HPL	"May the merciful gods, if indeed there be such, guard those hours when no power of the will, or drug that the cunning of man devises, can keep me from the chasm of sleep."
HPL	"Dr. West had been avid for a chance to serve as surgeon in a great war, and when the chance had come he carried me with him almost against my will."
HPL	"Whaddya want, feller booze, coke, or some other sorta dope?"
HPL	"My tale had been called ""The Attic Window"", and appeared in the January, , issue of Whispers."
HPL	Behind the figure was a vague suggestion of a Cyclopean architectural background.
HPL	What do maps and records and guide books really tell of the North End? Bah At a guess I'll guarantee to lead you to thirty or forty alleys and networks of alleys north of Prince Street that aren't suspected by ten living beings outside of the foreigners that swarm them.
HPL	"I can't read an Anacreontic without watering at the mouth and it's something a lot stronger than water that my mouth waters for"" ""Anacreontic what 'n hell's that?"" several hangers on looked up as the young man went slightly beyond their depth."
HPL	"But repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration, for the strange physician's extreme skill at once became manifest despite the ice coldness and shakiness of his bloodless looking hands."
HPL	"Between the phantasms of nightmare and the realities of the objective world a monstrous and unthinkable relationship was crystallising, and only stupendous vigilance could avert still more direful developments."
HPL	"Having filled my pockets with the flashlight's aid, I put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent."
HPL	"The odour arising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick eared Hawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there."
HPL	"The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity during the given period."
HPL	"And the trees still sheltered singing birds, and at evening the moon and stars looked down upon dewy blossoms in the walled rose gardens."
HPL	"He would sputter and fume, exploding into sesquipedalian admonitions and strange oaths, and animated by a frightful earnestness which brought a shudder to more than one drug racked mind in the crowded room."
HPL	"I had known Denys Barry well in America, where he had grown rich, and had congratulated him when he bought back the old castle by the bog at sleepy Kilderry."
HPL	"Like most youths, he indulged in elaborate day dreams of revenge, triumph, and final magnanimous forgiveness."
HPL	Then he had departed alone.
HPL	"Whether a modern student could ever gain similar powers from mathematical research alone, was still to be seen."
HPL	"There seemed to be unusual activity in the town, but I judged that the news of my escape from the Gilman had not yet spread."
HPL	"Wilbur's growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age."
HPL	"It had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little, for mention was made of specimens in the museum of Miskatonic University at Arkham, and in the display room of the Newburyport Historical Society."
HPL	"As I stared at the uncannily lighted door and windows, I became subject to the most extravagant visions visions so extravagant that I cannot even relate them."
HPL	"In a moment of childish imagination I vowed not only that the undertaker, Goodman Simpson, had stolen the silver buckled shoes, silken hose, and satin small clothes of the deceased before burial; but that the Squire himself, not fully inanimate, had turned twice in his mound covered coffin on the day after interment."
HPL	Vision or nightmare it may have been vision or nightmare I fervently hope it was yet it is all that my mind retains of what took place in those shocking hours after we left the sight of men.
HPL	The cause of the conference was a horror that brooded on the hills.
HPL	"Upon coming back, after the death of Lady Jermyn, he himself assumed complete care of the boy."
HPL	"It had done a deed, but the squatters had fired the cabin in frenzy before it could escape."
HPL	"Once I caught the name of Charles Le Sorcier, and again I fancied that the words ""years"" and ""curse"" issued from the twisted mouth."
HPL	From some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs.
HPL	"All was as of old, nor were the marble walls discoloured, nor the polished bronze statues upon them tarnished."
HPL	"It was this frightful emotional need which led us eventually to that detestable course which even in my present fear I mention with shame and timidity that hideous extremity of human outrage, the abhorred practice of grave robbing."
HPL	"As the moon climbed higher in the sky, I began to see that the slopes of the valley were not quite so perpendicular as I had imagined."
HPL	Carter's relatives talk much of these things because he has lately disappeared.
HPL	"And when tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the Elder Ones, then great eager vapours flock to heaven laden with lore; and Kingsport, nestling uneasy on its lesser cliffs below that awesome hanging sentinel of rock, sees oceanward only a mystic whiteness, as if the cliff's rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of the buoys tolled free in the aether of faery."
HPL	"Cable advices from Dunedin report that the Alert was well known there as an island trader, and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront."
HPL	To this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that fearsome hill.
HPL	"We had hardly more than turned, however, when there descended such a blinding sheet of torrential rain that shelter became imperative."
HPL	The notes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young Wilcox had had his strange visitations.
HPL	"I remember the square of moonlight on the floor, that was not like any other light, and the visions that danced in the moonbeams when my mother sang to me."
HPL	They had shape for did not this star fashioned image prove it?
HPL	"The boat did not at once descend to match the greater ocean depth, so I was soon forced to adjust the searchlight to cast a sharply downward beam."
HPL	"One night, as he was returning from his work, I intercepted Zann in the hallway and told him that I would like to know him and be with him when he played."
HPL	"War and revolution were raging across the seas; a dynasty had collapsed, and its degenerate subjects were flocking with dubious intent to the Western Land."
HPL	"Yet some quality about it disturbed me almost as much as its features pleased me perhaps it was too white, or too expressionless, or too much out of keeping with the locality, to make me feel easy or comfortable."
HPL	It was for this reason that the N'bangus carried it off.
HPL	"Of my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff, and of my delirious journey back to the stranded boat, I remember little."
HPL	"There were suggestions of the vague, twilight abysses, and of still vaster, blacker abysses beyond them abysses in which all fixed suggestions of form were absent."
HPL	"The other three were what sent him unconscious for they were living entities about eight feet high, shaped precisely like the spiky images on the balustrade, and propelling themselves by a spider like wriggling of their lower set of starfish arms."
HPL	"The bodies had to be exceedingly fresh, or the slight decomposition of brain tissue would render perfect reanimation impossible."
HPL	"Elwood was out late that night, and Gilman waited up for him."
HPL	"I did faint after emptying the fourth carboy, which I had to handle after the fumes had begun to penetrate my mask; but when I recovered I saw that the hole was emitting no fresh vapours."
HPL	"It argued a capability of believing in phenomena beyond all normal notions; for if a dead man can transmit his visible or tangible image half across the world, or down the stretch of the centuries, how can it be absurd to suppose that deserted houses are full of queer sentient things, or that old graveyards teem with the terrible, unbodied intelligence of generations?"
HPL	"But Alfred Trever did not speak the truth, as many guessed when he offered to take charge of the body and secure its interment in Appleton."
HPL	"Gilman mechanically attended classes that morning, but was wholly unable to fix his mind on his studies."
HPL	"In , after the death of his mother, Sir Arthur Jermyn determined to pursue his investigations to the utmost extent."
HPL	"Then I thought of the season, and felt that these old Puritan folk might well have Christmas customs strange to me, and full of silent hearthside prayer."
HPL	"He that came with the Aklo Sabaoth said I may be transfigured, there being much of outside to work on."""
HPL	Had he not told his colleagues to be as gentle as possible with the pathetic old sea captain?
HPL	"""And why is everybody so down on Innsmouth?"
HPL	"I had been lying with my face away from my uncle's chair, so that in this sudden flash of awakening I saw only the door to the street, the more northerly window, and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the room, all photographed with morbid vividness on my brain in a light brighter than the glow of the fungi or the rays from the street outside."
HPL	"There was a vortex of withering, ice cold wind, and then the rattle of loose bricks and plaster; but I had mercifully fainted before I could learn what it meant."
HPL	Among the agonies of these after days is that chief of torments inarticulateness.
HPL	"A large camera on a table excited my notice, and Pickman told me that he used it in taking scenes for backgrounds, so that he might paint them from photographs in the studio instead of carting his outfit around the town for this or that view."
HPL	"Louis, son to Robert, was found drowned in the moat at the same fateful age, and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous chronicle; Henris, Roberts, Antoines, and Armands snatched from happy and virtuous lives when little below the age of their unfortunate ancestor at his murder."
HPL	"Yet still there came that monotonous piping from afar; wild, weird airs that made me think of some dance of fauns on distant Maenalus."
HPL	The men from Arkham were undecided what to do.
HPL	"The men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly, pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain."
HPL	"The white apes and the stuffed goddess were discussed with all the native chiefs of the region, but it remained for a European to improve on the data offered by old Mwanu."
HPL	"My knock was answered in good English by a curious voice some distance to the right, asking my name and business; and these things being stated, there came an opening of the door next to the one I had sought."
HPL	"My host was now leading the way down cellar to his actual studio, and I braced myself for some hellish effects among the unfinished canvases."
HPL	"Just as I dropped to sleep I fancied I heard faint sounds from the distance; sounds that were wild and half musical, and stirred me with a weird excitement which coloured my dreams."
HPL	"Sometimes one feels that it would be merciful to tear down these houses, for they must often dream."
HPL	"I saw the attic laboratory, the electrical machine, and the unsightly form of Tillinghast opposite me; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar material objects not one particle was vacant."
HPL	"Between then and the next January we secured three more; one total failure, one case of marked muscular motion, and one rather shivery thing it rose of itself and uttered a sound."
HPL	"""We'd better both go,"" he whispered."
HPL	"""You did see it until it got dark."""
HPL	"Oh, I kin tell ye, little pitchers hev big ears, an' I wa'n't missin' nothin' o' what was gossiped abaout Cap'n Obed an' the folks aout to the reef Heh, heh, heh Haow abaout the night I took my pa's ship's glass up to the cupalo an' seed the reef a bristlin' thick with shapes that dove off quick soon's the moon riz?"
HPL	"Matter it seemed not to be, nor ether, nor anything else conceivable by mortal mind."
HPL	"I will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets; the deserted tomb of the Hydes, an old and exalted family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before my birth."
HPL	"It was queer damnably queer and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as if half expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the strange faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the Harris family."
HPL	The Rue d'Auseil lay across a dark river bordered by precipitous brick blear windowed warehouses and spanned by a ponderous bridge of dark stone.
HPL	"Lunch and dinner were brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either."
HPL	"His brow was white as the marble of Pentelicus, and of a height and breadth almost godlike."
HPL	"Come, Mister Randy, or Hannah wun't keep supper no longer"" So Randolph Carter was marched up the road where wondering stars glimmered through high autumn boughs."
HPL	"The farm like grounds extended back very deeply up the hill, almost to Wheaton Street."
HPL	"I liked it there, for the doctors were broad minded, and even lent me their influence in obtaining the carefully sheltered copy of Alhazred's objectionable Necronomicon from the library of Miskatonic University."
HPL	"I've had 'em pointed out to me here though, come to think of it, the elder children don't seem to be around lately."
HPL	"""But that ain't the trouble naow that was only the start."
HPL	It was an impossibility in a normal world.
HPL	"Armitage,"" he said, ""I calc'late I've got to take that book home."
HPL	"Herbert West, whose associate and assistant I was, possessed scientific interests far beyond the usual routine of a village physician."
HPL	"With Mr. Addison and Dr. Swift I later became very well acquainted, and was an even more familiar Friend to Mr. Pope, whom I knew and respected till the Day of his Death."
HPL	"As it was, he failed in Calculus D and Advanced General Psychology, though not without hope of making up lost ground before the end of the term."
HPL	"But more marvellous still were the palaces and the temples, and the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king."
HPL	"Now and then, beneath the brown pall of leaves that rotted and festered in the antediluvian forest darkness, I could trace the sinister outlines of some of those low mounds which characterised the lightning pierced region."
HPL	The first object of my curiosity was a book of medium size lying upon the table and presenting such an antediluvian aspect that I marvelled at beholding it outside a museum or library.
HPL	"Looking about me, I beheld many marble slabs bearing coffins, or the remains of coffins."
HPL	"I saw when I staggered to my feet that the amorphous flute player had rolled out of sight, but that two of the beasts were patiently standing by."
HPL	"She had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had taught her."
HPL	"""I want whiskey good old fashioned rye"" exclaimed Trever enthusiastically."
HPL	"Among the gnarled trees in the front yard of his aged and neglected place he maintains a strange collection of large stones, oddly grouped and painted so that they resemble the idols in some obscure Eastern temple."
HPL	"Once she hinted to the child Dutee of a somewhat peculiar circumstance in Mercy's last moments, but he had soon forgotten all about it save that it was something peculiar."
HPL	When the crowd was gone I saw the grave bearded man who had brought me to this place standing alone with a lantern.
HPL	"And the queer part was, that Pickman got none of his power from the use of selectiveness or bizarrerie."
HPL	"There were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast; peacocks from the isles of Nariel in the Middle Ocean, young goats from the distant hills of Implan, heels of camels from the Bnazic desert, nuts and spices from Cydathrian groves, and pearls from wave washed Mtal dissolved in the vinegar of Thraa."
HPL	"The door, a ponderous and forbidding slab of stone, hangs upon rusted iron hinges, and is fastened ajar in a queerly sinister way by means of heavy iron chains and padlocks, according to a gruesome fashion of half a century ago."
HPL	"This, however, they found more easily planned than performed; since no sign of the party could be found in any direction."
HPL	"For the people of Ulthar were simple, and knew not whence it is all cats first came."
HPL	"He drew a revolver and motioned me to silence, then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door behind him."
HPL	It had become fiendishly disgusting by the time he disappeared; many of the experiments could not even be hinted at in print.
HPL	A sort of mad eyed monstrosity behind the leader seized on Herbert West.
HPL	"Despite what I had heard of this hotel in Newburyport, I signed the register, paid my dollar, let the clerk take my valise, and followed that sour, solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life."
HPL	"Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most superficial impostures?"
HPL	"It was from Kilderry that his father had come, and it was there that he wished to enjoy his wealth among ancestral scenes."
HPL	"For a century and more, it appeared, the Roulets had been well remembered and frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the quiet life of a New England seaport."
HPL	"How little does the earth self know of life and its extent How little, indeed, ought it to know for its own tranquillity Of the oppressor I cannot speak."
HPL	"I recall many things of Sam Johnson and his Club, having kept up my Membership in the Latter long after the Doctor's Death, at which I sincerely mourn'd."
HPL	"One steady patron a bank defaulter under cover came to converse with him quite regularly, and from the tone of his discourse ventured the opinion that he had been a writer or professor in his day."
HPL	"There is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comet's tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat winged mocking imps of Tartarus."
HPL	"In cloud ships the gods are wont to travel, and wise cotters have legends that keep them from certain high peaks at night when it is cloudy, for the gods are not lenient as of old."
HPL	"Atop the tallest of earth's peaks dwell the gods of earth, and suffer no man to tell that he hath looked upon them."
HPL	"After uncovering the entire surface, which consisted of three immense granite slabs, we stepped back some distance to survey the charnel scene; and Warren appeared to make some mental calculations."
HPL	"""Wal, Sir, it seems by the time Obed knowed them islanders they was all full o' fish blood from them deep water things."
HPL	"And behind the houses were walled rose gardens with hedged paths and sundials, where at evening the moon and stars would shine bewitchingly while fragrant blossoms glistened with dew."
HPL	"He had awaked to find himself standing bloody handed in the snow before his cabin, the mangled corpse of his neighbour Peter Slader at his feet."
HPL	"Gilman came from Haverhill, but it was only after he had entered college in Arkham that he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of elder magic."
HPL	"He had habitually slept at night beyond the ordinary time, and upon waking would often talk of unknown things in a manner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the hearts of an unimaginative populace."
HPL	"Why had it not taken its victims in natural order, with myself second, from whichever direction it had approached?"
HPL	"""Thou art a strange youth, and I like not thy face nor thy voice."
HPL	"As he did this he further demonstrated his eccentricity by casting a startled glance toward the lone curtained window, as if fearful of some intruder a glance doubly absurd, since the garret stood high and inaccessible above all the adjacent roofs, this window being the only point on the steep street, as the concierge had told me, from which one could see over the wall at the summit."
HPL	"We didn't hev them old charms to cut 'em off like folks in the Saouth Sea did, an' them Kanakys wudn't never give away their secrets."
HPL	"Moreover, to this day the people of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg fear eclipses, and pray by night when pale vapours hide the mountain top and the moon."
HPL	Then came the steady rattling at the back door.
HPL	"He pulled the steel like claws from his neck, and would have dragged the beldame over the edge of the gulf had not the claws received a fresh access of strength and closed in again."
HPL	"Now, as the baying of that dead, fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder, and the stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed web wings circles closer and closer, I shall seek with my revolver the oblivion which is my only refuge from the unnamed and unnamable."
HPL	"At the sides of their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed."
HPL	"Then hoary Nodens reached forth a wizened hand and helped Olney and his host into the vast shell, whereat the conches and the gongs set up a wild and awesome clamour."
HPL	"There was a door, but it led only into a closet."
HPL	Yog Sothoth knows the gate.
HPL	"As he listened he thought a rhythmic confusion of faint musical pipings covering a wide tonal range welled up from the narrow streets beneath, and he wished he might discern the denizens of the place."
HPL	"For an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seething astern; where God in heaven the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky spawn was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened every second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam."
HPL	"He did not himself understand these words, or know why certain things made him feel certain emotions; but fancied that some unremembered dream must be responsible."
HPL	"It was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a confused babel of voices sounded down the road."
HPL	"I remember the night I made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor, and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from Tartary had brought."
HPL	"At twenty he had joined a band of music hall performers, and at thirty six had deserted his wife and child to travel with an itinerant American circus."
HPL	"But his wife had said she found a funny tin thing in one of the beds when she fixed the rooms at noon, and maybe that was it."
HPL	"It was plain that the owner had come home; but he had not come from the land, nor from any balloon or airship that could be imagined."
HPL	"A rush of cool air greeted me; and though the day was one of the hottest of late June, I shivered as I crossed the threshold into a large apartment whose rich and tasteful decoration surprised me in this nest of squalor and seediness."
HPL	"Of course, one can't be sure, but we can always take a chance."
HPL	In appearance all were marked by a peculiar inherited dissimilarity of eyes; one generally being blue and the other brown.
HPL	"The Fryes, huddled together in the sitting room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in Cold Spring Glen."
HPL	"But it made men dream, and so they knew enough to keep away."
HPL	"When the red Aldebaran, which blinked low in the sky but never set, had crawled a quarter of the way around the horizon, I saw light and motion in the houses and the streets."
HPL	"Whence he had come, no one could tell."
HPL	"Carter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms; for their cheapness and squalor sickened a spirit loving beauty alone, while his reason rebelled at the flimsy logic with which their champions tried to gild brute impulse with a sacredness stripped from the idols they had discarded."
HPL	"It was a octopus, centipede, spider kind o' thing, but they was a haff shaped man's face on top of it, an' it looked like Wizard Whateley's, only it was yards an' yards acrost. . ."
HPL	Strange and awesome were many of the objects I encountered.
HPL	"Complaints from many liberal organisations were met with long confidential discussions, and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons."
HPL	"The language in which the discourse was clothed was that debased form of Latin in use amongst the more learned men of the Middle Ages, and made familiar to me by my prolonged researches into the works of the old alchemists and daemonologists."
HPL	"That he really knew nothing of the hidden cult, save from what my uncle's relentless catechism had let fall, he soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which he could possibly have received the weird impressions."
HPL	"The walls melted away, and I was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with the needle like pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me."
HPL	"The tall grass near her was moving, too, as if some other living thing were crawling close to the ground."
HPL	"They're hard to get started, but once they do get started they never let up."
HPL	"At the hospital they told me I had been found half frozen in Kingsport Harbour at dawn, clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to save me."

HPL	"He could not recall what he had dreamed in the sky perched hut of that still nameless hermit, or say how he had crept down that crag untraversed by other feet."
HPL	We got all kinds here reel life an' a good time.
HPL	"Well, I should say that the really weird artist has a kind of vision which makes models, or summons up what amounts to actual scenes from the spectral world he lives in."

HPL	A word with any outsider was a relief to him.
HPL	Ain't ben seed abaout in public fer nigh on ten year'.
HPL	"Seething, stewing, surging, bubbling like serpents' slime it rolled up and out of that yawning hole, spreading like a septic contagion and streaming from the cellar at every point of egress streaming out to scatter through the accursed midnight forests and strew fear, madness, and death."
HPL	"Desrochers, too, had something to say in fact, he insisted that cautious steps had sounded in the now vacant room above him on the first and second nights of Gilman's absence from it."
HPL	"Hey? Think the old man's crazy, eh? Wal, Sir, let me tell ye that ain't the wust"" Zadok was really screaming now, and the mad frenzy of his voice disturbed me more than I care to own."
HPL	"So after that I did not listen for merriment or look for wayfarers, but kept on down past the hushed lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone walls to where the signs of ancient shops and sea taverns creaked in the salt breeze, and the grotesque knockers of pillared doorways glistened along deserted, unpaved lanes in the light of little, curtained windows."
HPL	"It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualised by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common life forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions."
HPL	"When I told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused; and after a tense hour of reflection, arrived at a definite and drastic decision."
HPL	"Of my exact age, even down to days and hours, I kept a most careful record, for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library told off so much more of my doomed existence."
HPL	"We were no vulgar ghouls, but worked only under certain conditions of mood, landscape, environment, weather, season, and moonlight."
HPL	Mr. Czanek did not like to wait so long in the dark in such a place.
HPL	"Haff on 'em's clean gone, an' nigh haff o' them that's left is sucked most dry o' blood, with sores on 'em like they's ben on Whateley's cattle ever senct Lavinny's black brat was born."
HPL	But I might not be mad if those accursed tomb legions had not been so silent.
HPL	"That fishing paid less and less as the price of the commodity fell and large scale corporations offered competition, but there was never a dearth of fish around Innsmouth Harbour."
HPL	"Probably it was the shrill piping that awaked me, yet that piping was not what I noticed first when I opened my eyes."
HPL	"But speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the way the whippoorwills followed the change."
HPL	"The only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly; imitating the typical shamble of the Innsmouth folk as best I could, and trusting that no one or at least no pursuer of mine would be there."
HPL	"How it had ever come into the possession of a common sailor, neither he nor I could imagine."
HPL	"In she fell victim to a mild form of insanity, and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house; her elder maiden sister, Mercy Dexter, having moved in to take charge of the family."

HPL	"What the Red Glare Meant On the tempest racked night of November , , with a lantern which cast charnel shadows, I stood digging alone and idiotically in the grave of Jan Martense."
HPL	"And as we sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at last, saying: ""This is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained."""
HPL	"I was afeard never did no pryin' arter that awful night, an' never see one of them clost to in all my life."
HPL	"Accordingly I continued my experiments, though informing no one of their nature."
HPL	"If they all came from the same object it must have been an hysterical, delirious monstrosity."
HPL	"Now I ride with the mocking and friendly ghouls on the night wind, and play by day amongst the catacombs of Nephren Ka in the sealed and unknown valley of Hadoth by the Nile."
HPL	"The thing came abruptly and unannounced; a daemon, rat like scurrying from pits remote and unimaginable, a hellish panting and stifled grunting, and then from that opening beneath the chimney a burst of multitudinous and leprous life a loathsome night spawned flood of organic corruption more devastatingly hideous than the blackest conjurations of mortal madness and morbidity."
HPL	"My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously far flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past."
HPL	"Manton had two malignant wounds in the chest, and some less severe cuts or gougings in the back."
HPL	"Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint, malign odour about the village street, as of the massed mould and decay of centuries."
HPL	"Them as ud help special, ud git special rewards gold an' sech No use balkin', fer they was millions of 'em daown thar."
HPL	"""Your existing sense organs ears first, I think will pick up many of the impressions, for they are closely connected with the dormant organs."
HPL	"The moribund hermit's rage and fear, swelling to grotesque proportions, seemed likely to shatter what remained of his failing physique; and once a spasm caused him to clap his hands to his eyes and rush into the bathroom."
HPL	"that face with the red eyes an' crinkly albino hair, an' no chin, like the Whateleys . . ."
HPL	"Then came a deadly circuit of the tower, clinging to whatever holds the slimy wall could give; till finally my testing hand found the barrier yielding, and I turned upward again, pushing the slab or door with my head as I used both hands in my fearful ascent."
HPL	"This building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which I took to be the earliest civic centre, displaced after the Revolution by the present Town Square."
HPL	"This, he said, was to neutralise the compound and release the system to a normal relaxation so that the reanimating solution might freely work when injected."
HPL	"Instead, the first thing which caught my eye was a small rowboat pulling in toward the abandoned wharves and laden with some bulky, tarpaulin covered object."
HPL	"In a week or two it had visibly faded, and in the course of a few months it was hardly discernible with the naked eye."""
HPL	He found what he expected a skull crushed cruelly as if by savage blows so returning to Albany he openly charged the Martenses with the murder of their kinsman.
HPL	"That I am still alive and sane, is a marvel I cannot fathom."
HPL	"Also, he thinks some of the folks looks durned queer even fer Kanakys."
HPL	"You know, in ordinary art, there's all the difference in the world between the vital, breathing things drawn from Nature or models and the artificial truck that commercial small fry reel off in a bare studio by rule."

HPL	Just before he made the plunge the violet light went out and left him in utter blackness.
HPL	"Divorced from the enlightenment of civilisation, the strength of these Puritans turned into singular channels; and in their isolation, morbid self repression, and struggle for life with relentless Nature, there came to them dark furtive traits from the prehistoric depths of their cold Northern heritage."
HPL	"The fellahin knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why."
HPL	"For the long neglected latch was obviously broken, leaving the careless undertaker trapped in the vault, a victim of his own oversight."
HPL	"I have, on the contrary, delved deeply into all the antiquities of the place; and have personally explored every region, of whatever name, which could possibly answer to the street I knew as the Rue d'Auseil."
HPL	"formless phantasms and kaleidoscopic mutations of a ghoulish, remembered scene; forests of monstrous overnourished oaks with serpent roots twisting and sucking unnamable juices from an earth verminous with millions of cannibal devils; mound like tentacles groping from underground nuclei of polypous perversion . . ."
HPL	"I paint in the cellar, where the inspiration is thickest, but I've other rooms furnished on the ground floor."
HPL	"We don't know what it is, but we suspect it has something to do with what he did."
HPL	"The thing that lay half bent on its side in a foetid pool of greenish yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall, and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin."
HPL	"Once I thrust a candle within the nearly closed entrance, but could see nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward."
HPL	"Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men."
HPL	"He would have given much for a lantern or bit of candle; but lacking these, bungled semi sightlessly as best he might."
HPL	And Pickman had it as no man ever had it before or I hope to heaven ever will again.
HPL	"Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come."
HPL	"He was a man of immense height, probably more than six feet, though his stooping shoulders sometimes belied this fact."
HPL	"Finding nothing else, not even gold, the Superintendent abandoned his attempts; but a perplexed look occasionally steals over his countenance as he sits thinking at his desk."
HPL	"The old woman had been dragging the youth, while around the feet of the negro a tame rat was rubbing and weaving in the brown mud."
HPL	"Besides, what I once was is not in the least relevant to my narrative; save perhaps the fact that during my service in India I was more at home amongst white bearded native teachers than amongst my brother officers."
HPL	"My health and appearance grew steadily worse, till finally I was forced to give up my position and adopt the static, secluded life of an invalid."
HPL	By what malign fatality were we lured to that terrible Holland churchyard?
HPL	"Later, by virtue of its sheer impressiveness, it had found subconscious expression in dreams, in the bas relief, and in the terrible statue I now beheld; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one."
HPL	"After years he began to call the slow sailing stars by name, and to follow them in fancy when they glided regretfully out of sight; till at length his vision opened to many secret vistas whose existence no common eye suspects."
HPL	"He sometimes dreamed better when awake, and he wanted to use that key."
HPL	"In the morning it had been underfoot; afternoon found it rising in the southeast, and now it was roughly south but wheeling toward the west."
HPL	"So came he one night to the squalid cot of an antique shepherd, bent and dirty, who kept lean flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh."
HPL	"These things were bad enough, and these were all that gained belief among the persons whom I knew."
HPL	"And the tomb where you put those bones, and the other grave without an inscription the whole thing must be a bit terrible."""
HPL	"In the midst of these reflections, as if dramatically arranged to intensify them, there fell near by a terrific bolt of lightning followed by the sound of sliding earth."
HPL	"The fragmentary descriptions of these things were bald and prosaic, but they hinted to me an undercurrent of persistent strangeness."
HPL	"Christchurch Cemetery was the scene of a terrible killing; a watchman having been clawed to death in a manner not only too hideous for description, but raising a doubt as to the human agency of the deed."
HPL	Ibid's skull was proudly handed down from king to king of the Lombard line.
HPL	"And when I saw that this reef was but the black basalt crown of a shocking eikon whose monstrous forehead now shone in the dim moonlight and whose vile hooves must paw the hellish ooze miles below, I shrieked and shrieked lest the hidden face rise above the waters, and lest the hidden eyes look at me after the slinking away of that leering and treacherous yellow moon."
HPL	"Look here, do you know the whole North End once had a set of tunnels that kept certain people in touch with each other's houses, and the burying ground, and the sea?"
HPL	"It was no joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not see, but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon."
HPL	"Those who have watched the tall, lean, Terrible Old Man in these peculiar conversations, do not watch him again."
HPL	It was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had not suggested before something which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of.
HPL	Thoughts of the police and of the mad Italian both weighed heavily.
HPL	Suddenly I found myself wondering what the voices of those denizens would be like.
HPL	"Then came the shift as vast converging planes of a slippery looking substance loomed above and below him a shift which ended in a flash of delirium and a blaze of unknown, alien light in which yellow, carmine, and indigo were madly and inextricably blended."
HPL	God knows what I expected to find I only felt that I was digging in the grave of a man whose ghost stalked by night.
HPL	"Such a step, he said, would require only two stages; first, a passage out of the three dimensional sphere we know, and second, a passage back to the three dimensional sphere at another point, perhaps one of infinite remoteness."
HPL	"The enigmas of the Symbolists and the ecstasies of the pre Raphaelites all were ours in their time, but each new mood was drained too soon of its diverting novelty and appeal."
HPL	"New kinds of faces appeared in The Street; swarthy, sinister faces with furtive eyes and odd features, whose owners spoke unfamiliar words and placed signs in known and unknown characters upon most of the musty houses."
HPL	"On one side I could view the entire city as it sloped from the plaza down to the old river bank; on the other side, in startling proximity, I was confronted by the richly ornate and perfectly preserved facade of a great building, evidently a temple, hollowed from the solid rock."
HPL	"Bennett was asleep, having apparently felt the same anomalous drowsiness which affected me, so I designated Tobey for the next watch although even he was nodding."
HPL	"Then they all sprang at him and tore him to pieces before my eyes, bearing the fragments away into that subterranean vault of fabulous abominations."
HPL	"It is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young, before ever the men of Sarnath came to the land of Mnar, another city stood beside the lake; the grey stone city of Ib, which was old as the lake itself, and peopled with beings not pleasing to behold."
HPL	"""That refinery, though, used to be a big thing, and Old Man Marsh, who owns it, must be richer'n Croesus."
HPL	"And nearest of all was the graveyard, where deformed trees tossed insane branches as their roots displaced unhallowed slabs and sucked venom from what lay below."
HPL	I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a nameless thing at the bottom of a pit.
HPL	"His long hair and flowing beard were of a terrible and intense black hue, and of incredible profusion."
HPL	"We also talked at length with such of the mountain mongrels as had not fled from the terror and confusion to remoter slopes, and arranged to precede our culminating task the exhaustive and definitive examination of the mansion in the light of its detailed history with an equally exhaustive and definitive examination of spots associated with the various tragedies of squatter legend."
HPL	"And the bearded man spoke no word, but watched me as we approached the lily lined shore."
HPL	"This was the dream in which I saw a shoggoth for the first time, and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming."
HPL	"Being now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor, I departed on the following day for London, taking with me the amulet after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the impious collection in the museum."
HPL	But the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young woman Enoch and Lydia Meserve Marsh among the known families of New Hampshire.
HPL	"In the darkness below there loomed the vast blurred outlines of a vessel breaking up on the cruel rocks, and as I glanced out over the waste I saw that the light had failed for the first time since my grandfather had assumed its care."
HPL	"Birch, before , had been the village undertaker of Peck Valley; and was a very calloused and primitive specimen even as such specimens go."
HPL	"Once or twice I saw listless looking people working in barren gardens or digging clams on the fishy smelling beach below, and groups of dirty, simian visaged children playing around weed grown doorsteps."
HPL	"Merciful gods of earth, I am falling into the sky"" And as Atal shut his eyes and stopped his ears and tried to jump downward against the frightful pull from unknown heights, there resounded on Hatheg Kla that terrible peal of thunder which awaked the good cotters of the plains and the honest burgesses of Hatheg and Nir and Ulthar, and caused them to behold through the clouds that strange eclipse of the moon that no book ever predicted."
HPL	"Many times afterward I saw him under the full moon, and ever did he beckon me."
HPL	"Yet the force of the elements was such as to overcome my scruples, and I did not hesitate to wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the closed door which seemed at once so suggestive and secretive."
HPL	"I must be careful how I record my awaking today, for I am unstrung, and much hallucination is necessarily mixed with fact."
HPL	"Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at Cambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get home again, as if he feared the results of being away long."
HPL	"The attempt, however, was enough to disturb my balance; so that I had to stagger forward several steps to avoid falling."
HPL	"I seem to have suffered a great shock perhaps from some utterly monstrous outgrowth of my cycles of unique, incredible experience."
HPL	"I don't believe there were three houses in sight that hadn't been standing in Cotton Mather's time certainly I glimpsed at least two with an overhang, and once I thought I saw a peaked roof line of the almost forgotten pre gambrel type, though antiquarians tell us there are none left in Boston."
HPL	"But of what followed, and of the reason I was found alone and dazed on the edge of the swamp next morning, I must insist that I know nothing save what I have told you over and over again."
HPL	"An' the smell was awful, like what it is araound Wizard Whateley's ol' haouse. . ."
HPL	"It was almost a public affair, for the dean had surely been a public benefactor."
HPL	"If you'll keep cool, and accept the need for making certain radical readjustments in your life, you can keep right on enjoying the world, and the fruits of your scholarship."
HPL	"Sally she yelled aout, 'O help, the haouse is a cavin' in' . . ."
HPL	"And when I looked upon the terraces again I saw that what he said was true, for among the sights before me were many things I had once seen through the mists beyond the horizon and in the phosphorescent depths of ocean."
HPL	"The youth said that he was very restless, seldom sitting around the station for more than an hour or two at a time."
HPL	"Though the hands of its clock were missing on the side I glimpsed, I knew that those hoarse strokes were telling the hour of eleven."
HPL	"Chords, vibrations, and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand; while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty."
HPL	"From that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehension, nor do I know how much is hideous truth and how much madness."
HPL	"Another might not have relished the damp, odorous chamber with the eight carelessly placed coffins; but Birch in those days was insensitive, and was concerned only in getting the right coffin for the right grave."
HPL	"I was glad I had chosen to walk, for the white village had seemed very beautiful from the hill; and now I was eager to knock at the door of my people, the seventh house on the left in Green Lane, with an ancient peaked roof and jutting second story, all built before ."
HPL	"In any case such a monster must of necessity be in our scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder, whose extirpation forms a primary duty with every man not an enemy to the world's life, health, and sanity."
HPL	"Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety."
HPL	"Instinct guided him in his wriggle through the transom, and in the crawl which followed his jarring thud on the damp ground."
HPL	But I must try to tell what I thought I saw that night under the mocking yellow moon saw surging and hopping down the Rowley road in plain sight in front of me as I crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut.
HPL	"In the dank twilight I climbed the worn and aged stone stairs till I reached the level where they ceased, and thereafter clung perilously to small footholds leading upward."
HPL	"He bent toward me, took hold of my coat lapel, and hissed out some hints that could not be mistaken."
HPL	"Most of the students went home, or to various duties, as the evening advanced; but West persuaded me to aid him in ""making a night of it""."
HPL	"""Long have I missed thee, Aira, for I was but young when we went into exile; but my father was thy King and I shall come again to thee, for it is so decreed of Fate."
HPL	"I was alone, yet bound to the unknown depths by those magic strands whose insulated surface lay green beneath the struggling beams of that waning crescent moon."
HPL	"I know suthin' awful's abaout, an' feel my time is nigh, though only Gawd knows jest what it is."
HPL	"I now visited the accursed place with increased frequency; studying the unwholesome vegetation of the garden, examining all the walls of the building, and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor."
HPL	"others'll worship with us at meetin' time, an' sarten haouses hez got to entertain guests . . ."
HPL	"They insisted that this was Kingsport, and I could not deny it."
HPL	"Galpin now devoted his time to the library and lecture platform, preparing volumes and speeches on various subjects connected with belles lettres, and always shewing a genius so remarkable that it seemed as if the public must sometime pardon him for his past mistakes."
HPL	It was the mind and character of Arthur Jermyn which atoned for his aspect.
HPL	"The epidemic and riots of were very sparsely treated, as if they formed a discredit to the county."
HPL	I have tried to hint what it was in order to postpone the horror of writing it down baldly.
HPL	It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least interest in archaeology.
HPL	In the small hours of the morning a body of silent men had entered the grounds and their leader had aroused the attendants.
HPL	"In this case an overwhelming preponderance of evidence from numerous authentic sources pointed to the tenacious existence of certain forces of great power and, so far as the human point of view is concerned, exceptional malignancy."
HPL	"Sheehan's is the acknowledged centre to Chicago's subterranean traffic in liquor and narcotics, and as such has a certain dignity which extends even to the unkempt attachés of the place; but there was until lately one who lay outside the pale of that dignity one who shared the squalor and filth, but not the importance, of Sheehan's."
HPL	"So here we all were in the mystic sunset of the autumn hills old Scribonius Libo in his toga prætexta, the golden light glancing on his shiny bald head and wrinkled hawk face, Balbutius with his gleaming helmet and breastplate, blue shaven lips compressed in conscientiously dogged opposition, young Asellius with his polished greaves and superior sneer, and the curious throng of townsfolk, legionaries, tribesmen, peasants, lictors, slaves, and attendants."
HPL	"He had not survived his return, said his wife, for the doings at sea in had broken him."
HPL	"His height could not have been less than six feet, and despite a general air of age and poverty he was stout and powerful in proportion."
HPL	What was it that had enmeshed him?
HPL	"Several times he seemed near daylight, only to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle."
HPL	"""They whistle jest in tune with my breathin' naow,"" he said, ""an' I guess they're gittin' ready to ketch my soul."
HPL	"The most sumptuous of these with wide terraced parterres extending back the whole way to Lafayette Street I took to be the home of Old Man Marsh, the afflicted refinery owner."
HPL	"""Sir,"" I reply'd, ""you are mistaken."
HPL	"The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that ""Lavinny's black brat"" had commenced to talk, and at the age of only eleven months."
HPL	"Natheless at the next full moon I boarded the White Ship, and with the reluctant bearded man left the happy harbour for untravelled seas."
HPL	"If humanly possible, I would use it; if not, I would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge."
HPL	"Gibbon, the Historian, Dr. Burney, the Musician, Mr. Malone, the Critick, and Mr. Boswell."
HPL	"Klenze seemed very nervous, and drank heavily."
HPL	"His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idol capped monoliths in lonely places."
HPL	I took it because of the queer old brick well in the cellar one of the sort I told you about.
HPL	"Custom had dinned into his ears a superstitious reverence for that which tangibly and physically exists, and had made him secretly ashamed to dwell in visions."
HPL	"The old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had memorised, and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not memorised."
HPL	"In a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a futile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about."
HPL	She knew Uncle Chris well enough to expect such things of the Carter blood.
HPL	"On each occasion investigation revealed nothing, and we began to ascribe the occurrences to imagination alone that same curiously disturbed imagination which still prolonged in our ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the Holland churchyard."
HPL	"The strange stone house on the woodland slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation; and its cold, damp interior, into which I vainly peered through the aperture so tantalisingly left, contained for me no hint of death or decay."
HPL	"The excited countryside immediately connected the horror with the haunted Martense mansion, though the localities were over three miles apart."
HPL	"At length, upon a suggestion of my uncle's, I decided to try the spot nocturnally; and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric torch over the mouldy floor with its uncanny shapes and distorted, half phosphorescent fungi."
HPL	"""Everything cleaned up in the mornin' but they was traces. . . ."
HPL	"Poor old soul to what pitiful depths of hallucination had his liquor, plus his hatred of the decay, alienage, and disease around him, brought that fertile, imaginative brain He began to moan now, and tears were coursing down his channelled cheeks into the depths of his beard."
HPL	The condition of this bridge would determine my next step.
HPL	But this is what I shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper before I drew a match and burned it to a crisp; what I puzzled out in terror as the landlady and two mechanics rushed frantically from that hellish place to babble their incoherent stories at the nearest police station.
HPL	"why cannot the doctors give me something to make me sleep, or truly calm my brain when it thunders?"
HPL	Very nervously he watched that narrow oaken gate in the high and ivy clad stone wall.
HPL	"We entered the laboratory in the attic, and I observed that detestable electrical machine, glowing with a sickly, sinister, violet luminosity."
HPL	"Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died."
HPL	"It seemed to be a sort of monster, or symbol representing a monster, of a form which only a diseased fancy could conceive."
HPL	"Not more unutterable could have been the chaos of hellish sound if the pit itself had opened to release the agony of the damned, for in one inconceivable cacophony was centred all the supernal terror and unnatural despair of animate nature."
HPL	"A touch of colour came to cheeks hitherto chalk white, and spread out under the curiously ample stubble of sandy beard."
HPL	"Indeed, there were always vague local tales of unexplained stenches upstairs in the Witch House just after May Eve and Hallowmass."
HPL	"He now refused to admit me at any time, and shunned me whenever we met on the stairs."
HPL	"After all, the strangest and maddest of myths are often merely symbols or allegories based upon truth and old Zadok must have seen everything which went on around Innsmouth for the last ninety years."
HPL	"Probably the clerk would make the price easy for me, but there was nothing else to do."
HPL	There was a vibration as if the wood had fallen farther than it had fallen before.
HPL	"And those who came were never as those who went away; for their accents were coarse and strident, and their mien and faces unpleasing."
HPL	"Queer old duck, though, and sticks mighty close in his home."
HPL	"At noon he lunched at the University Spa, picking up a paper from the next seat as he waited for dessert."
HPL	"He reigns there still, and will reign happily forever, though below the cliffs at Innsmouth the channel tides played mockingly with the body of a tramp who had stumbled through the half deserted village at dawn; played mockingly, and cast it upon the rocks by ivy covered Trevor Towers, where a notably fat and especially offensive millionaire brewer enjoys the purchased atmosphere of extinct nobility."
HPL	"We may guess that in dreams life, matter, and vitality, as the earth knows such things, are not necessarily constant; and that time and space do not exist as our waking selves comprehend them."
HPL	"""Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heerd the 'phone a ringin', an' it was Mis' Corey, George's wife, that lives daown by the junction."
HPL	"I will repeat here what he said, underlining the words he emphasised: ""He is calling He is calling I hear him We must go"" As he spoke he took his ivory image from the table, pocketed it, and seized my arm in an effort to drag me up the companionway to the deck."
HPL	"Handsome knights they were, astride roan horses and clad in shining armour with tabards of cloth of gold curiously emblazoned."
HPL	The note which he finally handed me was an appeal for tolerance and forgiveness.
HPL	"A closer scrutiny filled me with sensations I cannot express; for despite its enormous magnitude, and its position in an abyss which had yawned at the bottom of the sea since the world was young, I perceived beyond a doubt that the strange object was a well shaped monolith whose massive bulk had known the workmanship and perhaps the worship of living and thinking creatures."
HPL	"In the Land of Sona Nyl there is neither time nor space, neither suffering nor death; and there I dwelt for many aeons."
HPL	You can bet that prying strangers ain't welcome around Innsmouth.
HPL	"At length I saw a grass grown opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls, with the weedy length of an earth and masonry wharf projecting beyond."
HPL	This daemoniac laughter which I hear as I write comes only from my own weakening brain.
HPL	"He could not tell why he approached the farther wall so confidently, or why he instinctively drew forth the great silver key as he did so."
HPL	One evening at about eight I heard a spattering on the floor and became suddenly aware that I had been smelling the pungent odour of ammonia for some time.
HPL	"The abode of the race whose scions are here inurned had once crowned the declivity which holds the tomb, but had long since fallen victim to the flames which sprang up from a disastrous stroke of lightning."
HPL	"As I have said before, the weird studies of Harley Warren were well known to me, and to some extent shared by me."
HPL	Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence.
HPL	It was not like the very old folk to spare their victims at the Sabbath.
HPL	"He reeled, and would have crumpled to the ground had not two or three others seized and steadied him."
HPL	"He always remained lame, for the great tendons had been severed; but I think the greatest lameness was in his soul."
HPL	"I cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to shew why the sound of the water against the vessel's sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped my ears with cotton."
HPL	"Finally he decided to lay a base of three parallel with the wall, to place upon this two layers of two each, and upon these a single box to serve as the platform."
HPL	They were as baffling as the hordes of great bats which haunted the old manor house in unprecedented and increasing numbers.
HPL	"This morning the strange pulls from space seemed lessened, though they were replaced by another sensation even more inexplicable."
HPL	"Two Lascar sailors at once helped him to his feet, but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead."
HPL	"Of its origin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain head."
HPL	"One seldom saw them; but a few times a year they sent down little yellow, squint eyed messengers who looked like Scythians to trade with the merchants by means of gestures, and every spring and autumn they held the infamous rites on the peaks, their howlings and altar fires throwing terror into the villages."
HPL	Wonderful likewise were the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king.
HPL	What the things agreed to give in return was plenty o' fish they druv 'em in from all over the sea an' a few gold like things naow an' then.
HPL	and some were strangely robed . . .
HPL	"Joe Slater was indeed awaking, though probably for the last time."
HPL	Y'ha nthlei was not destroyed when the upper earth men shot death into the sea.
HPL	"I had arrived at the abyss, which was now redly aglow, and which had evidently swallowed up the unfortunate Romero."
HPL	"And in a few years more, men built cabins on the south side of The Street."
HPL	"I had done all I could, and hoped I was in time."
HPL	"Later a queer boldness and recklessness came into my demeanour, till I unconsciously grew to possess the bearing of a man of the world despite my lifelong seclusion."
HPL	"The ancient house has always been there, and people say One dwells therein who talks with the morning mists that come up from the deep, and perhaps sees singular things oceanward at those times when the cliff's rim becomes the rim of all earth, and solemn buoys toll free in the white aether of faery."
HPL	"Of the distance between the hamlet and the mansion, fully two miles and a quarter on the hamlet's side was entirely open country; the plain being of fairly level character save for some of the low snake like mounds, and having as vegetation only grass and scattered weeds."
HPL	"Only a very rare affliction, of course, could bring about such vast and radical anatomical changes in a single individual after maturity changes involving osseous factors as basic as the shape of the skull but then, even this aspect was no more baffling and unheard of than the visible features of the malady as a whole."
HPL	"In those greenish beams the candles paled, and a new semblance of decay spread over the musk reeking room with its wormy panelling, sagging floor, battered mantel, rickety furniture, and ragged draperies."
HPL	"Whateley saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly."
HPL	"His figure, lean to the proportions of a skeleton, was strangely bent and almost lost within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment."
HPL	"One March night, however, we unexpectedly obtained a specimen which did not come from the potter's field."
HPL	We kept track of all the deaths and their circumstances with systematic care.
HPL	"Then dawn swam dripping and mist wreathed out of the sea, and the buoys tolled solemn in vortices of white aether."
HPL	"The fires must be lit, and the dancers must be starting in."
HPL	"Amidst such stupendous ruin only chaos dwelt, and the representatives of two cities left disappointed; Syracusans that they had no statue to bear home, Tegeans that they had no artist to crown."
HPL	"The place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks, and we can't be sure about the ins and outs of the matter; but it's pretty clear that old Captain Marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties."
HPL	"It isn't so very far from the elevated as distance goes, but it's centuries away as the soul goes."
HPL	"A high bred face of masterful though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short iron grey full beard, and an old fashioned pince nez shielded the full, dark eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a Moorish touch to a physiognomy otherwise dominantly Celtiberian."
HPL	"This aroused my curiosity, for I knew of no deep sea organism capable of emitting such luminosity."
HPL	"Pinned with a thumb tack to a vacant part of the canvas was a piece of paper now badly curled up probably, I thought, a photograph from which Pickman meant to paint a background as hideous as the nightmare it was to enhance."
HPL	"""An' then she let aout a turrible yell, an' says the shed daown the rud had jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over, only the wind wa'n't strong enough to dew that."
HPL	"I had seen it before, let footprints tell what they might; and where it was I had seen it were best forgotten."
HPL	"From the tangle of chimney pots scarcely a wisp of smoke came, and the three tall steeples loomed stark and unpainted against the seaward horizon."
HPL	"Swimming races out to Devil Reef were very common, and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport."
HPL	"It was, the Belgian averred, a most extraordinary object; an object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify."
HPL	"Beyond these things he seemed to know nothing, nor could the expert questioning of his interrogators bring out a single additional fact."
HPL	"He would write of what he knew before death came, but his wife must not guess."
HPL	"""Doctair Muñoz,"" she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me, ""he have speel hees chemicals."
HPL	"It may have been just fear, and it may have been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for bygone crudities."
HPL	"""Glad ye was nigh the haouse en' hed the sense ta come right in."
HPL	We had started quietly from the village because of the reporters who still lingered about after the eldritch panic of a month before the nightmare creeping death.
HPL	"Something had caught my ancestor on a dark valley road, leaving him with marks of horns on his chest and of ape like claws on his back; and when they looked for prints in the trampled dust they found the mixed marks of split hooves and vaguely anthropoid paws."
HPL	"Then came a sort of island of higher ground, where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles."
HPL	"There was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that; since its brier choked desertion made it half impassable, and the unlikeliest of all avenues for a fugitive to choose."
HPL	"Normal beings seldom visited the locality till the state police were formed, and even now only infrequent troopers patrol it."
HPL	"This, then, was the former Masonic Hall now given over to a degraded cult."
HPL	"Upon returning home I went with much directness to a rotting chest in the attic, wherein I found the key which next day unlocked with ease the barrier I had so long stormed in vain."
HPL	But it was not in these vortices of complete alienage that he saw Brown Jenkin.
HPL	"There was one black tower which reached above the trees into the unknown outer sky, but that was partly ruined and could not be ascended save by a well nigh impossible climb up the sheer wall, stone by stone."
HPL	"It was a grey, bleak day, with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the northwest."
HPL	"My next logical goal was New Church Green, but somehow or other I could not bear to repass the church in whose basement I had glimpsed the inexplicably frightening form of that strangely diademed priest or pastor."
HPL	"However, it would be better for the gentleman to take another room and get a crucifix from some good priest like Father Iwanicki."
HPL	"Elwood scarcely dared to touch him, but gradually the screaming and writhing subsided."
HPL	"They spoke of old Keziah Mason, and Elwood agreed that Gilman had good scientific grounds for thinking she might have stumbled on strange and significant information."
HPL	"People around the country and in the nearby towns muttered a great deal among themselves, but said very little to the outer world."
HPL	"Armitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and heard the echoes of a burglar alarm still shrilling from the library."
HPL	There was a rift where a part of the substance was folded over.
HPL	"Upon the outbreak of trouble with Great Britain in , William Harris, despite his scant sixteen years and feeble constitution, managed to enlist in the Army of Observation under General Greene; and from that time on enjoyed a steady rise in health and prestige."
HPL	"De Langlade regarded this sacred object with proper veneration and ransomed it at the expense of many glass beads; yet after his time it found itself in many other hands, being traded to settlements at the head of Lake Winnebago, to tribes around Lake Mendota, and finally, early in the nineteenth century, to one Solomon Juneau, a Frenchman, at the new trading post of Milwaukee on the Menominee River and the shore of Lake Michigan."
HPL	"I wondered if my host could help me in the task at which I was labouring, and resolved to ask him about it later on."
HPL	"Open up the gates to Yog Sothoth with the long chant that ye'll find on page of the complete edition, an' then put a match to the prison."
HPL	"One eye was blue, the other brown."
HPL	Only one wish now haunted the mind of the dying man; that twigs from certain olive trees in the grove be buried by his resting place close to his head.
HPL	All I can say is that they came from something I had known as a friend.
HPL	"Well do I remember the night of the great Aurora, when over the swamp played the shocking coruscations of the daemon light."
HPL	"Only old Zebulon, who was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation."
HPL	"It is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken steepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet."
HPL	"It was, indeed, an exceedingly singular happening; though after all a simple one."
HPL	"Shortly afterward I was taken through those antique ways so dear to my fancy narrow, curving alleys and passages where rows of red Georgian brick blinked with small paned dormers above pillared doorways that had looked on gilded sedans and panelled coaches and in the first flush of realisation of these long wished things I thought I had indeed achieved such treasures as would make me in time a poet."
HPL	"The building, then, must still be inhabited, despite its isolation and general neglect."
HPL	"His interest gradually veered away from the unplumbed voids beyond the slanting surfaces, since it now appeared that the purpose of those surfaces concerned the side he was already on."
HPL	"Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under Johansen's command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude , W. Longitude come upon a coast line of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth's supreme terror the nightmare corpse city of R'lyeh, that was built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars."
HPL	Mebbe they was the kind o' critters as got all the mermaid stories an' sech started.
HPL	"And in the later watches of the night, when I went within the tower, I saw on the wall a calendar which still remained as when I had left it at the hour I sailed away."
HPL	"Accordingly my watches by the dank portal became less persistent, and much of my time was spent in other though equally strange pursuits."
HPL	"In all the cities of Cydathria and in the lands beyond the Bnazic desert gay faced children laughed at his olden songs and tattered robe of purple; but Iranon stayed ever young, and wore wreaths upon his golden head whilst he sang of Aira, delight of the past and hope of the future."
HPL	But before I could investigate there came a third impression which because of its irrationality caused me to doubt the objectivity of anything my senses might record.
HPL	"In his second son, Nevil, a singularly repellent person who seemed to combine the surliness of Philip Jermyn with the hauteur of the Brightholmes, ran away with a vulgar dancer, but was pardoned upon his return in the following year."
HPL	"Three months previously five of the little squint eyed traders had come down from the hills, and in a market brawl three of them had been killed."
HPL	"Dr. Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day."
HPL	"But Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy three years, and slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever."
HPL	They must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow.
HPL	"Though I well realised the futility of imaginative and metaphysical arguments against the complacency of an orthodox sun dweller, something in the scene of this afternoon colloquy moved me to more than usual contentiousness."
HPL	"A second later the downward motion of the knife broke the spell completely, and he dropped the bowl with a resounding bell like clangour while his hands darted out frantically to stop the monstrous deed."
HPL	"Alfred was himself a scholar and poet of distinction, though cursed with a certain childish irresponsibility which made him an ideal prey for Sheehan's runner."
HPL	"Mebbe ye'd like to a ben me in them days, when I seed things at night aout to sea from the cupalo top o' my haouse."
HPL	"There had seemed to be no one in the courtyard below, and I hoped there would be a chance to get away before the spreading of a general alarm."
HPL	"The sight turned him giddy after a while, so that he would have fallen to the pavement had he not clutched instinctively at the lustrous balustrade."
HPL	No more ice the man looked and ran away.
HPL	"Prompted by some preserving instinct of self defence, I broke through the spell that had hitherto held me immovable, and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced my existence."
HPL	"The hills rose scarlet and gold to the north of the little town, and the westering sun shone ruddily and mystically on the crude new stone and plaster buildings of the dusty forum and the wooden walls of the circus some distance to the east."
HPL	"As soon as the torch, which I lowered into the repellent depths, burned freely and steadily, I commenced my descent."
HPL	"At length, after temporarily felling one of his detainers with a sudden blow, he had flung himself upon the other in a daemoniac ecstasy of bloodthirstiness, shrieking fiendishly that he would 'jump high in the air and burn his way through anything that stopped him'."
HPL	"A strange headline item had struck at him from the crumpled pages, and a nameless titan claw had seemed to reach down through sixteen years."
HPL	"Sir Robert himself, after repeated attempts at suicide and a stubborn refusal to utter any articulate sound, died of apoplexy in the second year of his confinement."
HPL	"Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare."
HPL	"Furniture, covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with the rot of long dampness, met my eyes."
HPL	"Men of learning suspect it little, and ignore it mostly."
HPL	In time he grew so impatient of the bleak intervals of day that he began buying drugs in order to increase his periods of sleep.
HPL	"At one bend he saw the group of giant elms among which an ancestor had oddly vanished a century and a half before, and shuddered as the wind blew meaningly through them."
HPL	"Its cultural level had fallen very low, as proved by decaying furniture and scattered silverware which must have been long abandoned when its owners left."
HPL	"Three of the Emma's men, including Capt."
HPL	"Then he handed the instrument to Morgan, whose sight was keener."
HPL	"Stern as a Jewish prophet, and laconically unamazed as none since his day could be, he told of the beast that had brought forth what was more than beast but less than man the thing with the blemished eye and of the screaming drunken wretch that they hanged for having such an eye."
HPL	"It is the Land of Hope, and in it shine the perfect ideals of all that we know elsewhere; or at least so men relate."
HPL	"His name was Barzai the Wise, and the villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the strange eclipse."
HPL	"At the base of the hill a thirty foot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail."
HPL	Of their faces and forms I dare not speak in detail; for the mere remembrance makes me grow faint.
HPL	"For there, full in the rifted roadway, lay bleached and tranquil in bland, saintly, and consular pomp the dome like skull of Ibid There is nothing more absurd, as I view it, than that conventional association of the homely and the wholesome which seems to pervade the psychology of the multitude."
HPL	"It was in these slums along Main Street that I would find the old Georgian churches, but they were all long abandoned."
HPL	"My informant had noticed it many times, and had heard it spoken of as coming from some secret hoard, either of pirates or of daemons."
HPL	"The rabble were in terror, for upon an evil tenement had fallen a red death beyond the foulest previous crime of the neighbourhood."
HPL	"dee Hi Hi Randy"" A swaying lantern came around the black bend, and old Benijah pounced on the silent and bewildered form of the pilgrim."
HPL	"Geometrical shapes seethed around him, and he fell dizzily and interminably."
HPL	"It was, in fact, nothing more or less than an abundant supply of freshly killed men in every stage of dismemberment."
HPL	"The grave was not very deep, but fully as good as that of the previous specimen the thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound."
HPL	"That child, a boy, came in December; but was still born."
HPL	Such visions as I had experienced were too much for me to endure again.
HPL	"Back Bay isn't Boston it isn't anything yet, because it's had no time to pick up memories and attract local spirits."
HPL	One night I had a frightful dream in which I met my grandmother under the sea.
HPL	With me were two faithful and muscular men for whom I had sent when the time came; men long associated with me in my ghastly explorations because of their peculiar fitness.
HPL	"Some few of the legionarii shewed timidity, but sharp commands brought them into line, and the whole cohort was soon drawn up on the open plain east of the circus."
HPL	"Indeed, old Sir Wade had possessed an intellectual zeal amounting almost to a mania; his bizarre conjectures on a prehistoric white Congolese civilisation earning him much ridicule when his book, Observations on the Several Parts of Africa, was published."
HPL	"""I made some use of 'em,"" he would say as he tried to mend a torn black letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, ""but the boy's fitten to make better use of 'em."
HPL	"I can recall the scene now the desolate, pitch black garret studio under the eaves with the rain beating down; the ticking of the lone clock; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the dressing table; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the house; certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space; and worst of all the deep, steady, sinister breathing of my friend on the couch a rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden, unimagined, and hideously remote."
HPL	My formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of a Chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a Rochester.
HPL	"He considered the auriferous cavities the result of the action of water, and believed the last of them would soon be opened."
HPL	"He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been second mate of the two masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February th with a complement of eleven men."
HPL	Could it be that the dream soul inhabiting this inferior body was desperately struggling to speak things which the simple and halting tongue of dulness could not utter?
HPL	"Light indeed glowed on the panels ahead, but it was not any light that the moon gives."
HPL	"Others knew, but did not dare to tell there is no public hint of why they whispered about the lock on the door to the attic stairs in the house of a childless, broken, embittered old man who had put up a blank slate slab by an avoided grave, although one may trace enough evasive legends to curdle the thinnest blood."
HPL	"The way was rough and obscure, and never did they seem nearer to Oonai the city of lutes and dancing; but in the dusk as the stars came out Iranon would sing of Aira and its beauties and Romnod would listen, so that they were both happy after a fashion."
HPL	"Professor Angell's instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle's expense."
HPL	"And now he was equally resentful of awaking, for he had found his fabulous city after forty weary years."
HPL	"It was better than human material for maintaining life in organless fragments, and that was now my friend's chief activity."
HPL	"Thus isolated, and thrown upon my own resources, I spent the hours of my childhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the shadow haunted library of the chateau, and in roaming without aim or purpose through the perpetual dusk of the spectral wood that clothes the side of the hill near its foot."
HPL	"This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters."
HPL	"I can see it a little when I make the Voorish sign or blow the powder of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it is near like them at May Eve on the Hill."
HPL	"He had, though, heard the French Canadian who lodged just under Gilman talking to Mazurewicz one evening."
HPL	"She seemed to crystallise at a point closer to the ceiling than to the floor, and every night she was a little nearer and more distinct before the dream shifted."
HPL	The general tension was horrible.
HPL	"He paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallised into fresh terror."
HPL	"Where Gilman could have been, how he got back to his room without making tracks in the hall, and how the muddy, furniture like prints came to be mixed with his in the garret chamber, were wholly beyond conjecture."
HPL	"Had it not been for my old servant Hiram, I should have by this time become quite convinced of my madness."
HPL	"He was thankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering in, and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one."
HPL	"You tried to stop me; you discouraged me when I needed every drop of encouragement I could get; you were afraid of the cosmic truth, you damned coward, but now I've got you What swept up the servants?"
HPL	"The bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the centre, and I was looking at a large pillared hall on the right hand junction ahead."
HPL	"I am not given to emotion of any kind, but my amazement was very great when I saw what lay revealed in that electrical glow."
HPL	"West, in the midst of a severe battle, had reanimated Major Sir Eric Moreland Clapham Lee, D.S.O., a fellow physician who knew about his experiments and could have duplicated them."
HPL	"And I saw the world battling against blackness; against the waves of destruction from ultimate space; whirling, churning; struggling around the dimming, cooling sun."
HPL	"This man, Joseph D. Galvez, I later met and questioned; and he proved distractingly imaginative."
HPL	"That time we were almost caught before we incinerated the thing, and West doubted the advisability of repeating his daring misuse of the college laboratory."
HPL	"But during the dreams they did not horrify me at all I was one with them; wearing their unhuman trappings, treading their aqueous ways, and praying monstrously at their evil sea bottom temples."
HPL	"When a fumbling came in the nearer casements he crept around to the west again, flattening himself against the wall beside the now opened windows."
HPL	"Ibid's masterpiece, on the other hand, was the famous Op."
HPL	"In this kaleidoscopic vortex of phantasmal images were occasional snapshots, if one might use the term, of singular clearness but unaccountable heterogeneity."
HPL	"Of the longitude I knew nothing, and no island or coast line was in sight."
HPL	"In order to reach it, he said, he would soar through abysses of emptiness, burning every obstacle that stood in his way."
HPL	"Controlling my muscles, and realising afresh how plainly visible I was, I resumed my brisker and feignedly shambling pace; though keeping my eyes on that hellish and ominous reef as long as the opening of South Street gave me a seaward view."
HPL	"The usual sputtering began, turned to a whine, and terminated in a drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence."
HPL	"Approaching him softly though without apparent furtiveness were five figures, two of which were the sinister old woman and the fanged, furry little animal."
HPL	"Mumbled tales of the weird rites and godless revels of bygone years in the ancient hall gave to me a new and potent interest in the tomb, before whose door I would sit for hours at a time each day."
HPL	"And through this revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled, maddening beating of drums, and thin, monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond Time; the detestable pounding and piping whereunto dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic, tenebrous ultimate gods the blind, voiceless, mindless gargoyles whose soul is Nyarlathotep."
HPL	"I remarked, as I say, their grotesqueness and strange size; but in a moment decided that they were merely the imaginary gods of some primitive fishing or seafaring tribe; some tribe whose last descendant had perished eras before the first ancestor of the Piltdown or Neanderthal Man was born."
HPL	"From several directions in the distance, however, I could hear the sound of hoarse voices, of footsteps, and of a curious kind of pattering which did not sound quite like footsteps."
HPL	"Morning came wanly, and the night sounds ceased."
HPL	"From those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much, yet prove little."
HPL	"Then the Western Land itself awoke, and joined the Mother Land in her titanic struggle for civilisation."
HPL	"He did not walk or climb, fly or swim, crawl or wriggle; yet always experienced a mode of motion partly voluntary and partly involuntary."
HPL	"Above the crowded bookshelves at intervals along the walls were well wrought family portraits; all tarnished to an enigmatical dimness, and bearing an unmistakable likeness to the man who now motioned me to a chair beside the graceful Chippendale table."
HPL	"The Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February th, and had felt the full force of that earthquake born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea bottom the horrors that filled men's dreams."
HPL	"It seemed as if many bulging, watery, unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as I claimed my valise in the lobby, and I hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellow passengers on the coach."
HPL	"Corona Borealis, which my friend had appeared to dread, and whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing unseen through the measureless abysses of aether."
HPL	"I admired his clearness and persistence, and added some further revelations I had collected among the old people."
HPL	"He was the devil incarnate, Birch, and I believe his eye for an eye fury could beat old Father Death himself."
HPL	"It was in a grotesque hidden courtyard of the Greenwich section, for there in my ignorance I had settled, having heard of the place as the natural home of poets and artists."
HPL	"The Comte died without utterance, and was buried the next day, but little more than two and thirty years from the hour of his birth."
HPL	"Previously indifferent to such things, I had now an unspeakable horror of them; and would retire to the innermost recesses of the house whenever the heavens threatened an electrical display."
HPL	"The one glimpse he had had of the title was enough to send him into transports, and some of the diagrams set in the vague Latin text excited the tensest and most disquieting recollections in his brain."
HPL	"Just before dawn Arcturus winks ruddily from above the cemetery on the low hillock, and Coma Berenices shimmers weirdly afar off in the mysterious east; but still the Pole Star leers down from the same place in the black vault, winking hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some strange message, yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey."
HPL	Was I tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man's power to bear?
HPL	Johansen's voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice admiralty.
HPL	"He felt it was highly necessary to get the ponderous thing home and begin deciphering it, and bore it out of the shop with such precipitate haste that the old Jew chuckled disturbingly behind him."
HPL	"There were secrets, said the peasants, which must not be uncovered; secrets that had lain hidden since the plague came to the children of Partholan in the fabulous years beyond history."
HPL	"Armitage knew he would be meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before him."
HPL	"One night he had burst wildly into Sheehan's, foaming at the mouth and screaming for whiskey and hasheesh; and having been supplied in exchange for a promise to perform odd jobs, had hung about ever since, mopping floors, cleaning cuspidors and glasses, and attending to an hundred similar menial duties in exchange for the drink and drugs which were necessary to keep him alive and sane."
HPL	"The professor had been stricken whilst returning from the Newport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical looking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceased's home in Williams Street."
HPL	"He was drowsy near the end, and as darkness fell he dropped off into a troubled sleep."
HPL	"It seems that in both instances the dying person, in a gentle old lady named Stafford and in a school teacher of middle age named Eleazar Durfee, became transfigured in a horrible way; glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat of the attending physician."
HPL	I am an entity like that which you yourself become in the freedom of dreamless sleep.
HPL	"Throughout the siege of Rome he served bravely in the army of the defenders, and afterward followed the eagles of Belisarius to Alba, Porto, and Centumcellae."
HPL	"My first vivid impression of my own presence in this terrible necropolis concerns the act of pausing with Warren before a certain half obliterated sepulchre, and of throwing down some burdens which we seemed to have been carrying."
HPL	"On the night of September , , I heard a knock at my chamber door."
HPL	"Unfortunately no carvings could be found, and the small size of the expedition prevented operations toward clearing the one visible passageway that seemed to lead down into the system of vaults which Sir Wade had mentioned."
HPL	"They are almost hidden now in lawless luxuriances of green and guardian shrouds of shadow; but the small paned windows still stare shockingly, as if blinking through a lethal stupor which wards off madness by dulling the memory of unutterable things."
HPL	"He would shout that the world was in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of aeons ago."
HPL	The men were discussing the strange death of the Mexican as he lay asleep; a death seemingly connected in some way with the terrible bolt of lightning which had struck and shaken the mountain.
HPL	"The elderly scholar had been collecting legends of the Onga tribes near the field of his grandfather's and his own explorations, hoping in some way to account for Sir Wade's wild tales of a lost city peopled by strange hybrid creatures."
HPL	"And in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl and lapis lazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials, so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest flowers."
HPL	"There, where morbidity lurked most thickly, I searched and poked during long afternoons when the sunlight filtered in through the cobwebbed above ground windows, and a sense of security glowed from the unlocked door which placed me only a few feet from the placid sidewalk outside."
HPL	"This pair, shunned by all honest folk, were suspected of the most hideous practices."
HPL	They were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town; and even at my vast distance and in my single moment of perception I could tell that the bobbing heads and flailing arms were alien and aberrant in a way scarcely to be expressed or consciously formulated.
HPL	"Anyway, they're a doubtful lot now, and the Marshes and the other rich folks are as bad as any."
HPL	"We knew that there was scarcely a chance for anything like complete success, and could not avoid hideous fears at possible grotesque results of partial animation."
HPL	"Niches here and there contained skulls of all shapes, and heads preserved in various stages of dissolution."
HPL	It's just over your left shoulder. . .
HPL	"As the weeks passed, the playing grew wilder, whilst the old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful to behold."
HPL	"Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed squatters refused point blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before."
HPL	My opinion of my whole experience varies from time to time.
HPL	Professor Upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of higher mathematics to certain phases of magical lore transmitted down the ages from an ineffable antiquity human or pre human whose knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was greater than ours.
HPL	But don't get the idea that it was all this hideous business of theme and setting which struck me faint.
HPL	"Out the window I could see the blue water and the sandy line of Plum Island, and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway to Rowley and Ipswich."
HPL	"Very sleek and fat did the cats appear, and sonorous with purring content."
HPL	"It is rumoured in Ulthar, beyond the river Skai, that a new king reigns on the opal throne in Ilek Vad, that fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking the twilight sea wherein the bearded and finny Gnorri build their singular labyrinths, and I believe I know how to interpret this rumour."
HPL	"They included not only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed, but touched wildly on a gigantic thing ""miles high"" which walked or lumbered about."
HPL	"This time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs, so I knew that the prowler had realised the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a greater or lesser time, as the future would shew."
HPL	"Before Carter awaked, the gentle visitant had told him where to find that box; that carved oak box of archaic wonder whose grotesque lid no hand had raised for two centuries."
HPL	Then I noticed that I was not alone in the room and put the ray projector back in my pocket.
HPL	In Washington Street there was a row of four or five in excellent repair and with finely tended lawns and gardens.
HPL	"It was horrible, yet hardly a surprise."
HPL	"Pausing only long enough to look at two fine but ruinous old churches at Main and Church Streets, I hastened out of that vile waterfront slum."
HPL	Servants found me unconscious in the morning.
HPL	"The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship."
HPL	"Thar's his head on thet bench, with one arm side of it, an' t'other arm's on the graound side o' the meat block."""
HPL	"And yet I am strangely content, and cling desperately to those sere memories, when my mind momentarily threatens to reach beyond to the other."
HPL	"Rice, beside him, took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects; whilst Morgan uncased the big game rifle on which he relied despite his colleague's warnings that no material weapon would be of help."
HPL	"On the left the creek threaded countryside was nearer, the narrow road to Ipswich gleaming white in the moonlight."
HPL	I never heard of Innsmouth till the day before I saw it for the first and so far last time.
HPL	"His expressionless face was handsome to the point of radiant beauty, but had shocked the superintendent when the hall light fell on it for it was a wax face with eyes of painted glass."
HPL	"Two of the figures I glimpsed were in voluminous robes, and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight."
HPL	"In a dream Kuranes saw the city in the valley, and the sea coast beyond, and the snowy peak overlooking the sea, and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward the distant regions where the sea meets the sky."
HPL	"In truth, much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk, they feared them more; and instead of berating them as brutal assassins, merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees."
HPL	"Next would come the south windows, under the great low eaves on the side where he stood; and it must be said that he was more than uncomfortable as he thought of the detestable house on one side and the vacancy of upper air on the other."
HPL	"""I guess he's sayin' the spell,"" whispered Wheeler as he snatched back the telescope."
HPL	"Policemen appeared at the door, attracted by the noise, but for a time they made no move to intervene."
HPL	"The southeastward pull still held, and only with tremendous resolution could Gilman drag himself into the old house and up the rickety stairs."
HPL	"Old legends are hazy and ambiguous, and in historic times all attempts at crossing forbidden gaps seem complicated by strange and terrible alliances with beings and messengers from outside."
HPL	"But he remembered it again when he walked down a white path toward a red roofed pagoda, and would have questioned the people of that land about it, had he not found that there were no people there, but only birds and bees and butterflies."
HPL	"Over the valley's rim a wan, waning crescent moon peered through the noisome vapours that seemed to emanate from unheard of catacombs, and by its feeble, wavering beams I could distinguish a repellent array of antique slabs, urns, cenotaphs, and mausolean facades; all crumbling, moss grown, and moisture stained, and partly concealed by the gross luxuriance of the unhealthy vegetation."
HPL	"What it suggested, however, was of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate action."
HPL	West clashed disagreeably with Dr. Halsey near the end of our last undergraduate term in a wordy dispute that did less credit to him than to the kindly dean in point of courtesy.
HPL	"Mr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon; but the text, printed in Springfield, is still extant."
HPL	"There had, however, been a riot of some sort later on perhaps forty years later, after old Roulet's death and no one seemed to hear of the family after that."
HPL	"Disliking the sight, I turned away and entered the chamber beyond the Gothic door."
HPL	"It appeared that I was a provincial quæstor named L. Cælius Rufus, and that I had been summoned by the proconsul, P. Scribonius Libo, who had come from Tarraco some days before."
HPL	"Apparently Whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton; at least, in any true or stable sense."
HPL	"The natives, all of whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as Armitage and his companions."
HPL	"He could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dream bas relief, but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands."
HPL	After that we lived in growing horror and fascination.
HPL	"He had slowly tried to perfect a solution which, injected into the veins of the newly deceased, would restore life; a labour demanding an abundance of fresh corpses and therefore involving the most unnatural actions."
HPL	"And he perceived that there was no door on this landward end, but only a couple of small lattice windows with dingy bull's eye panes leaded in seventeenth century fashion."
HPL	"As I opened the window I noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings, and also that there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior."
HPL	"Someone telephoned the news to the Aylesbury Transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the Associated Press."
HPL	"He was a victim of physical and nervous suffering, as was I; and my metaphysical studies had taught me kindness."
HPL	"Then, very softly and slowly, the acre great panel began to give inward at the top; and they saw that it was balanced."
HPL	"""Can you dare you go far?"""
HPL	"A weak, filtered glow from the rain harassed street lamps outside, and a feeble phosphorescence from the detestable fungi within, shewed the dripping stone of the walls, from which all traces of whitewash had vanished; the dank, foetid, and mildew tainted hard earth floor with its obscene fungi; the rotting remains of what had been stools, chairs, and tables, and other more shapeless furniture; the heavy planks and massive beams of the ground floor overhead; the decrepit plank door leading to bins and chambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone staircase with ruined wooden hand rail; and the crude and cavernous fireplace of blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past presence of hooks, andirons, spit, crane, and a door to the Dutch oven these things, and our austere cot and camp chairs, and the heavy and intricate destructive machinery we had brought."
HPL	"The steps were many, and led to a narrow stone flagged passage which I knew must be far underground."
HPL	"Poor John His Son fared better, I think, and was made a Baronet."
HPL	"This town had some queer people, and there had undoubtedly been several disappearances."
HPL	"The tower at length finished, and his aching arms rested by a pause during which he sat on the bottom step of his grim device, Birch cautiously ascended with his tools and stood abreast of the narrow transom."
HPL	"Then the three of us dragged from another room a wide four poster bedstead, crowding it laterally against the window."
HPL	"Elwood had been studying in the small hours and had come up for help on a differential equation, only to find Gilman absent."
HPL	"Crossing the threshold into that swarming temple of unknown darkness, I turned once to look at the outside world as the churchyard phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on the hill top pavement."
HPL	"No one, however, had been using the telescope at that instant."
HPL	"And the lips of the dead lotos faces whispered sadly, and bade me follow, nor did I cease my steps till the stream became a river, and joined amidst marshes of swaying reeds and beaches of gleaming sand the shore of a vast and nameless sea."
HPL	"Believing I was now at a prodigious height, far above the accursed branches of the wood, I dragged myself up from the floor and fumbled about for windows, that I might look for the first time upon the sky, and the moon and stars of which I had read."
HPL	"It's all the same now, for he's gone back into the fabulous darkness he loved to haunt."
HPL	"The dream narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions."
HPL	"The dark blocks of granite, the door so curiously ajar, and the funereal carvings above the arch, aroused in me no associations of mournful or terrible character."
HPL	The youth's own pastor Dr. Wallace of Asbury M. E. Church in Arkham had gravely urged him not to join any church in Innsmouth.
HPL	Yet I soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and fascination.
HPL	"M. Verhaeren, Belgian agent at a trading post on the Congo, believed that he could not only locate but obtain the stuffed goddess, of which he had vaguely heard; since the once mighty N'bangus were now the submissive servants of King Albert's government, and with but little persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had carried off."
HPL	And there were many small shrines and temples where one might rest or pray to small gods.
HPL	"."" rang the hideous croaking out of space."
HPL	"Well, young fellow, you mustn't take too much stock in what people around here say."
HPL	"Considering this topography, we had finally concluded that the daemon must have come by way of Cone Mountain, a wooded southern prolongation of which ran to within a short distance of the westernmost spur of Tempest Mountain."
HPL	"Despite weakness, hunger, horror, and bewilderment I found myself after a long time able to walk; so started slowly along the muddy road to Rowley."
HPL	"For a moment I was inclined to use persuasion, regarding rather lightly the whims of senility; and even tried to awaken my host's weirder mood by whistling a few of the strains to which I had listened the night before."
HPL	"We chose our house with the greatest care, seizing at last on a rather run down cottage near the end of Pond Street; five numbers from the closest neighbour, and separated from the local potter's field by only a stretch of meadow land, bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to the north."
HPL	"It was a key a guide to certain gateways and transitions of which mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young, and which lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms of life and matter that we know."
HPL	"I was still alone, for as much as I feared the unknown horror I sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling anybody."
HPL	"Springing to the floor, he washed and dressed in frantic haste, as if it were necessary for him to get out of the house as quickly as possible."
HPL	"Hei Hei At last In the dim light I behold the gods of earth"" And now Atal, slipping dizzily up over inconceivable steeps, heard in the dark a loathsome laughing, mixed with such a cry as no man else ever heard save in the Phlegethon of unrelatable nightmares; a cry wherein reverberated the horror and anguish of a haunted lifetime packed into one atrocious moment: ""The other gods The other gods The gods of the outer hells that guard the feeble gods of earth . . ."
HPL	"The man was clad in very ancient garments, and had about him an unplaceable nimbus of sea lore and dreams of tall galleons."
HPL	"As the names Trever, Lawrence, and Appleton fell on the air, the loafers seemed to sense something unusual."
HPL	"But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of drug and dream pushed me through, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end; for in that new realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space."
HPL	"He had been found covered with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and rending of a boy by a pair of wolves."
HPL	"All honour was now his, since the Tyrant of Syracuse would have the work of none save him or Kalos."
HPL	"Against the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers rose and raced from sight, frantic at that which they had sought for prey."
HPL	"It was in a deep, damp hollow, overgrown with rank grass, moss, and curious creeping weeds, and filled with a vague stench which my idle fancy associated absurdly with rotting stone."
HPL	"Had they known, the coincidence of names would have brought some drastic and frightened action indeed, might not its limited whispering have precipitated the final riot which erased the Roulets from the town?"
HPL	"Of this Infirmity, indeed, I had known before; having heard of it from Mr. Pope, who took the Trouble to make particular Inquiries."
HPL	"West and I were doing post graduate work in summer classes at the medical school of Miskatonic University, and my friend had attained a wide notoriety because of his experiments leading toward the revivification of the dead."
HPL	"He had been somewhere he ought not to be; had strayed very far away to places where he had not belonged, and was now inexcusably late."
HPL	"I had been travelling for some time amongst the people of the Miskatonic Valley in quest of certain genealogical data; and from the remote, devious, and problematical nature of my course, had deemed it convenient to employ a bicycle despite the lateness of the season."
HPL	"Shadows thickened around him, for the night was near."
HPL	"There had been something wrong with the engine, despite the excellent time made from Newburyport, and the bus could not complete the journey to Arkham."
HPL	"That place was very old, and the ceiling high shelves full of rotting volumes reached back endlessly through windowless inner rooms and alcoves."
HPL	"Then I thought with a shudder of what old Castro had told Legrasse about the primal Great Ones: ""They had come from the stars, and had brought Their images with Them."""
HPL	"George Bennett and William Tobey had left no trace, not even of a struggle."
HPL	"The loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared."
HPL	"My identity, too, is bewilderingly cloudy."
HPL	"A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky."
HPL	Things are hunting me now the things that devour and dissolve but I know how to elude them.
HPL	"At night, as of yore, Musides sought the banquet halls of Tegea whilst Kalos wandered alone in the olive grove."
HPL	"Gilman believed strange things about Keziah, and had felt a queer thrill on learning that her dwelling was still standing after more than years."
HPL	"Upon the death of Theodoric in , Ibidus retired from public life to compose his celebrated work whose pure Ciceronian style is as remarkable a case of classic atavism as is the verse of Claudius Claudianus, who flourished a century before Ibidus; but he was later recalled to scenes of pomp to act as court rhetorician for Theodatus, nephew of Theodoric."
HPL	"Excavation was much easier than I expected, though at one point I encountered a queer interruption; when a lean vulture darted down out of the cold sky and pecked frantically at the grave earth until I killed him with a blow of my spade."
HPL	And I beg of you to let that thing on the table the thing that looks like a match box alone.
HPL	"So now I am to end it all, having written a full account for the information or the contemptuous amusement of my fellow men."
HPL	I can shew you houses that have stood two centuries and a half and more; houses that have witnessed what would make a modern house crumble into powder.
HPL	"The next April sickness occurred among the children, and Abigail and Ruth died before the month was over."
HPL	"And when he heard these things his sobbing gave place to meditation, and finally to prayer."
HPL	"On this deep bony layer rested a knife of great size, obvious antiquity, and grotesque, ornate, and exotic design above which the debris was piled."
HPL	"And above the nighted screaming of men and horses that dæmonic drumming rose to louder pitch, whilst an ice cold wind of shocking sentience and deliberateness swept down from those forbidden heights and coiled about each man separately, till all the cohort was struggling and screaming in the dark, as if acting out the fate of Laocoön and his sons."
HPL	"I s'pose you know though I can see you're a Westerner by your talk what a lot our New England ships used to have to do with queer ports in Africa, Asia, the South Seas, and everywhere else, and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with 'em."
HPL	"The physician questioned him sharply, and advised him to see a nerve specialist."
HPL	He didn't call it out.
HPL	"Come to the window and be quiet."""
HPL	"His wife, bringing his dinner, found him in a half comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken."
HPL	"Over two hours must have passed before I reached what seemed to be my goal, a venerable ivied castle in a thickly wooded park; maddeningly familiar, yet full of perplexing strangeness to me."
HPL	"The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness."
HPL	"Somehaow or other, though, he never would let him see one of the reg'lar things from right aout o' the water."
HPL	"In his dream he had heard a scratching and gnawing in the partitions, and thought that someone fumbled clumsily at the latch."
HPL	"A room was easy to secure; for the house was unpopular, hard to rent, and long given over to cheap lodgings."
HPL	"I guess they're what they call 'white trash' down South lawless and sly, and full of secret doings."
HPL	"Most of its earlier length was uncomfortably visible from the Rowley road, and from high places in the town itself; but one could perhaps crawl inconspicuously through the undergrowth."
HPL	"The abyss was now a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean splendour, and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past glittering clouds and silvery coruscations."
HPL	"It had looked very queer to her, but of course the young gentleman had lots of queer things in his room books and curios and pictures and markings on paper."
HPL	"Nothing was heard for some time; just how long Soames cannot exactly estimate; but it was certainly less than a quarter of an hour later that the horrible scream, undoubtedly in Jermyn's voice, was heard."
HPL	"Anxious to leave Washington Street, I broke into a quiet dog trot, trusting to luck not to encounter any observing eye."
HPL	"Into the lands of civilisation came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger."
HPL	"Sometimes he would take walks through shadowy tangles of unpaved musty smelling lanes where eldritch brown houses of unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow, small paned windows."
HPL	"Maria had been at the shunned house from till the removal of the family in , and had seen Mercy Dexter die."
HPL	"My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness in recognising both hieroglyphics and pictorial design."
HPL	"The town was now a city, and one by one the cabins gave place to houses; simple, beautiful houses of brick and wood, with stone steps and iron railings and fanlights over the doors."
HPL	"I had but little notion of how the thought impressions would, if successfully conveyed, arouse an intelligent response in my brain; but I felt certain that I could detect and interpret them."
HPL	He looked curiously at me for a second as he returned forty cents change without speaking.
HPL	"Ugh There are few persons I loathe more than that cursed little Syrian rat I have myself been carried back to Roman times by my recent perusal of James Rhoades' Æneid, a translation never before read by me, and more faithful to P. Maro than any other versified version I have ever seen including that of my late uncle Dr. Clark, which did not attain publication."
HPL	"Calm, lasting beauty comes only in dream, and this solace the world had thrown away when in its worship of the real it threw away the secrets of childhood and innocence."
HPL	"The ship sank quite picturesquely, bow first, the stern rising high out of the water whilst the hull shot down perpendicularly to the bottom of the sea."
HPL	"Endlessly down the horsemen floated, their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over golden sands; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater brightness, the brightness of the city Celephaïs, and the sea coast beyond, and the snowy peak overlooking the sea, and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky."
HPL	"We often cast a beam around the ship, but saw only dolphins, swimming parallel to our own drifting course."
HPL	"Neither did his old physician Dr. Davis, who died years ago."
HPL	But in that instant of curiosity was born the madly unreasoning desire which has brought me to this hell of confinement.
HPL	Out of the South it would glide very smoothly and silently over the sea.
HPL	"Then they looked oddly at me, and said that they seemed to remember weird sounds, too."
HPL	"I thought of those very extreme Innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling, centuried warrens near the waterfront."
HPL	"Space belongs to me, do you hear?"
HPL	"Our experiences had often been hideous in the extreme; the results of defective reanimation, when lumps of graveyard clay had been galvanised into morbid, unnatural, and brainless motion by various modifications of the vital solution."
HPL	"On the thirteenth day they reached the mountain's lonely base, and Atal spoke of his fears."
HPL	"Braced up by Elwood's companionship, Gilman attended classes that day."
HPL	"It was after a night like this that I shocked the community with a queer conceit about the burial of the rich and celebrated Squire Brewster, a maker of local history who was interred in , and whose slate headstone, bearing a graven skull and crossbones, was slowly crumbling to powder."

HPL	Arthur Jermyn went out on the moor and burned himself after seeing the boxed object which had come from Africa.
HPL	"Copp's Hill Burying Ground, which could not be many blocks away from this very house, was a favourite scene."
HPL	"We began to march in the new dusk, with the thin silver sickle of a young moon trembling over the woods on our left."
HPL	To what extent could the laws of sanity apply to such a case?
HPL	"Armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied Whateley's gorilla like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window."
HPL	Maounds o' the dead an' the dyin' . . .
HPL	"Its details I shall never know; for my slumber, though troubled and dream infested, was continuous."
HPL	"Never mingling much with his kind, he had dropped gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of aesthetes from other towns."

HPL	"Shou'd my present Recollections meet with Favour, I might later set down some further Anecdotes of old Times of which I am the only Survivor."
HPL	"The stuffed goddess, he wrote, would arrive duly packed about a month after receipt of the letter."
HPL	"At the time, Pierre said that this restriction was imposed upon me because my noble birth placed me above association with such plebeian company."
HPL	"a couple o' weeks later, when nothin' had ben throwed into the sea fer that long. . ."
HPL	"Toward the last I became acutely afraid of West, for he began to look at me that way."
HPL	"Was, indeed, Fate preserving my reason only to draw me irresistibly to an end more horrible and unthinkable than any man has dreamed of?"
HPL	"His build and lower facial features were like other clergymen I had seen, but he had a vastly higher forehead, and was darker and more intelligent looking also more subtly and concealedly evil looking."
HPL	"Then unexpectedly my hands came upon a doorway, where hung a portal of stone, rough with strange chiselling."
HPL	"""That's why I wouldn't go at night if I was you."
HPL	"I did not expect it, either, for I thought I was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewellery would turn out to be."
HPL	"Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return."
HPL	"I had long before resolved to limit my observations to architecture alone, and I was even then hurrying toward the Square in an effort to get quick transportation out of this festering city of death and decay; but the sight of old Zadok Allen set up new currents in my mind and made me slacken my pace uncertainly."
HPL	"My key to the vault I kept suspended from a cord about my neck, its presence known only to me."
HPL	"Then came the storm of April nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness."
HPL	"That was in the gaoler had gone mad and babbled of a small, white fanged furry thing which scuttled out of Keziah's cell, and not even Cotton Mather could explain the curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red, sticky fluid."
HPL	"But not much is written of these beings, because they lived in very ancient times, and man is young, and knows little of the very ancient living things."
HPL	Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs. Corey.
HPL	"Give me that decanter, Eliot There was one thing called ""The Lesson"" heaven pity me, that I ever saw it Listen can you fancy a squatting circle of nameless dog like things in a churchyard teaching a small child how to feed like themselves?"
HPL	"Among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignity half ichthyic and half batrachian in suggestion which one could not dissociate from a certain haunting and uncomfortable sense of pseudo memory, as if they called up some image from deep cells and tissues whose retentive functions are wholly primal and awesomely ancestral."
HPL	Now and then we could see the lightning through the cracks in the wall; the afternoon was so incredibly dark that each flash was extremely vivid.
HPL	Often I ask myself if it could not all have been a pure phantasm a mere freak of fever as I lay sun stricken and raving in the open boat after my escape from the German man of war.
HPL	"One afternoon there was a discussion of possible freakish curvatures in space, and of theoretical points of approach or even contact between our part of the cosmos and various other regions as distant as the farthest stars or the trans galactic gulfs themselves or even as fabulously remote as the tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole Einsteinian space time continuum."
HPL	"Then he took me through a door on the left, lighted an oil lamp, and told me to make myself at home."
HPL	"The grease was gone, for the mouldy floor was porous."
HPL	"I thought, too, of those nameless swimmers I had seen."
HPL	"Occasionally an opposite pair, both leaning forward, almost met across the street like an arch; and certainly they kept most of the light from the ground below."
HPL	"Some extensive cave in had obliterated all trace of the underground passage, while the rain had washed so much earth back into the excavation that I could not tell how deeply I had dug that other day."
HPL	That I had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made certain to me by the words which I read.
HPL	And over all rose thoughts and fears which centred in the youth from the sea and the ivory image whose carving was duplicated on the frieze and columns of the temple before me.
HPL	As we clanked over the bridge I looked out on both sides and observed some factory buildings on the edge of the grassy bluff or part way down.
HPL	"I seemed to know what to do with it, for I drew a pocket electric light or what looked like one out of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes."
HPL	"That's because only a real artist knows the actual anatomy of the terrible or the physiology of fear the exact sort of lines and proportions that connect up with latent instincts or hereditary memories of fright, and the proper colour contrasts and lighting effects to stir the dormant sense of strangeness."
HPL	"And if added to this there be a repellent unkemptness; a wild disorder of dress, a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots, and an unchecked growth of pure white beard on a face once clean shaven, the cumulative effect is quite shocking."
HPL	"I yearned mightily to enter this fascinating yet repellent city, and besought the bearded man to land me at the stone pier by the huge carven gate Akariel; but he gently denied my wish, saying: ""Into Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many have passed but none returned."
HPL	"He couldn't stand what he had to do he had to get me in a strange, dark place when he minded my letter and nursed me back."
HPL	I felt myself on the edge of the world; peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night.
HPL	"Indeed, it was only by accident that after interminable writhings I jarred my forgotten electric lamp alight, so that it shone eerily along the burrow of caked loam that stretched and curved ahead."
HPL	"Next year I may be dwelling in the dark Egypt which you call ancient, or in the cruel empire of Tsan Chan which is to come three thousand years hence."
HPL	"He told me it was an old German viol player, a strange dumb man who signed his name as Erich Zann, and who played evenings in a cheap theatre orchestra; adding that Zann's desire to play in the night after his return from the theatre was the reason he had chosen this lofty and isolated garret room, whose single gable window was the only point on the street from which one could look over the terminating wall at the declivity and panorama beyond."
HPL	"That the psychic or intellectual life might be impaired by the slight deterioration of sensitive brain cells which even a short period of death would be apt to cause, West fully realised."
HPL	"Meanwhile the luminosity increased, waned again, then assumed a pale, outré colour or blend of colours which I could neither place nor describe."
HPL	He spoke of the flame eyed Crusader who learnt wild secrets of the Saracens that held him captive; and of the first Sir Randolph Carter who studied magic when Elizabeth was queen.
HPL	"The leaning, unpainted houses grew thicker, lined both sides of the road, and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind."
HPL	"But what actually absorbed our minds was the secret laboratory we had fitted up in the cellar the laboratory with the long table under the electric lights, where in the small hours of the morning we often injected West's various solutions into the veins of the things we dragged from the potter's field."
HPL	"""You could take that old bus, I suppose,"" he said with a certain hesitation, ""but it ain't thought much of hereabouts."
HPL	"Something else had gone on ahead a larger wisp which now and then condensed into nameless approximations of form and he thought that their progress had not been in a straight line, but rather along the alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos."
HPL	"I knew what he wanted to see if this highly organised body could exhibit, without its head, any of the signs of mental life which had distinguished Sir Eric Moreland Clapham Lee."
HPL	Immediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it; that this treasure alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave.
HPL	"Thither would I go were I old enough to find the way, and thither shouldst thou go an thou wouldst sing and have men listen to thee."
HPL	"He must meet the Black Man, and go with them all to the throne of Azathoth at the centre of ultimate Chaos."
HPL	Molehills . . . the damned place must be honeycombed . . .
HPL	"The authorities at Tulane University could shed no light upon either cult or image, and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the country and met with no more than the Greenland tale of Professor Webb."
HPL	"""It was Asaph's coffin, Birch, just as I thought I knew his teeth, with the front ones missing on the upper jaw never, for God's sake, shew those wounds The body was pretty badly gone, but if ever I saw vindictiveness on any face or former face. . . ."
HPL	"Legrasse, deeply impressed and not a little bewildered, had inquired in vain concerning the historic affiliations of the cult."
HPL	"Birch decided that he would begin the next day with little old Matthew Fenner, whose grave was also near by; but actually postponed the matter for three days, not getting to work till Good Friday, the th."
HPL	"The old man was pulling at my sleeve, but I was determined to be the last."
HPL	Warren would never tell me just what was in that book.
HPL	He knew he did walk and the thing to do now was to stop it.
HPL	"Well, don't worry, my friend, for they are coming. . . ."
HPL	"This fear grew stronger from what had before lessened it, for the more I looked at the old man's bland face the more its very blandness terrified me."
HPL	"Gilman dropped in at a doctor's office on the th of the month, and was surprised to find his temperature was not as high as he had feared."
HPL	"The poison was not having much effect, for scratchings and scurryings in the walls were virtually undiminished."
HPL	After that thing I had dug a grave for one whose death I could not understand.
HPL	"Earl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on the topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar stone but at a considerable distance from it."
HPL	"We were not, as I have said, in any sense childishly superstitious, but scientific study and reflection had taught us that the known universe of three dimensions embraces the merest fraction of the whole cosmos of substance and energy."
HPL	"Nor was I a stranger in the streets of Olathoë, which lies on the plateau of Sarkis, betwixt the peaks Noton and Kadiphonek."
HPL	"Presently Wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange, resonant fashion which hinted at sound producing organs unlike the run of mankind's."
HPL	Nobody never see 'em agin.
HPL	"Through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures, apparently running toward the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed."
HPL	"References to decline were few, though the significance of the later record was unmistakable."
HPL	"At night the subtle stirring of the black city outside, the sinister scurrying of rats in the wormy partitions, and the creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house, were enough to give him a sense of strident pandemonium."
HPL	"That the influence of the old house was unwholesome, he could not deny; but traces of his early morbid interest still held him there."
HPL	Trembling with a terror oddly mixed with ecstasy I crossed the circular room to the north window from which I could see the village and the plain at the edge of the bog.
HPL	Snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither Romero nor I had left the bunkhouse during the night; that neither had been awake during the frightful storm which had passed over the Cactus range.
HPL	"A purplish darkness, born of nothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky's blue, pressed down upon the rumbling hills."
HPL	"Thus was I left to ponder on myself as the only human creature within the great fortress, and in my utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom, to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many of my ancestors had met."
HPL	"Of the fate of that cohort no record exists, but the town at least was saved for encyclopædias tell of the survival of Pompelo to this day, under the modern Spanish name of Pompelona. . . ."
HPL	Manton was reflecting again.
HPL	"Perhaps in unremembered dreams tonight; perhaps in some other form an aeon hence, when the solar system shall have been swept away."""
HPL	"I had never, seemingly, heard human speech before; and could guess only vaguely what was said."
HPL	"But in the cosmos there is balm as well as bitterness, and that balm is nepenthe."
HPL	"It was this object, and not his peculiar personal appearance, which made him end his life."
HPL	"The next day Blandot gave me a more expensive room on the third floor, between the apartments of an aged money lender and the room of a respectable upholsterer."
HPL	"Here, let's have the chandelier going."
HPL	"As consciousness departed he heard the faint, shrill tittering of the fanged, rat like abnormality."
HPL	"And in the Stygian grotto I saw them do the rite, and adore the sick pillar of flame, and throw into the water handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered green in the chlorotic glare."
HPL	"As the ages passed, first one, then another of the four great turrets were left to ruin, until at last but a single tower housed the sadly reduced descendants of the once mighty lords of the estate."
HPL	"On June , Seamen Bohm and Schmidt, who had been ill the day before, became violently insane."
HPL	"Returning to the submarine, I turned off the lights and sat thinking in the dark."

HPL	The fellow must be a relentless enemy of all mankind to take such glee in the torture of brain and flesh and the degradation of the mortal tenement.
HPL	But success and happiness were not to be.
HPL	"He was called ""Old Bugs"", and was the most disreputable object in a disreputable environment."
HPL	I will tell the audient void. . . .
HPL	"Seems they hankered arter mixin' with the folks, an' havin' j'int ceremonies on the big days May Eve an' Hallowe'en."
HPL	"I had often heard of this work, with its curious illustrations by the brothers De Bry, hence for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the pages before me."
HPL	"Through all the land of Mnar and the lands adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from Sarnath, and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals no more."
HPL	"And now they were scattered, and shared only the rituals of mysteries that none living could understand."
HPL	"It was not a wholesome landscape after dark, and I believe I would have noticed its morbidity even had I been ignorant of the terror that stalked there."
HPL	never heerd o' my pa no more. . .
HPL	"Once in a while I noticed dead stumps and crumbling foundation walls above the drifting sand, and recalled the old tradition quoted in one of the histories I had read, that this was once a fertile and thickly settled countryside."
HPL	"At the end of the passable road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came."
HPL	"At length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had come from Aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of the Frye tragedy, decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable."
HPL	Only a stench and a tarry stickiness.
HPL	He wore rimless spectacles with steel bows.
HPL	"A confusion of associated ideas possessed my brain, leading me to grope back toward the farthest corner of the cellar."
HPL	These responses from aesthetes told a disturbing tale.
HPL	"For them are the catacombs of Ptolemais, and the carven mausolea of the nightmare countries."
HPL	Uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor.
HPL	For the gentle and noble features were those of his own mother.
HPL	That was what she said.
HPL	"God, what a rage I'd hate to have it aimed at me ""Why did you do it, Birch?"
HPL	"Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm."
HPL	"The climax of that awful night was composite but fairly brief, beginning just as I reached the final cavern of the journey."
HPL	"When, however, I asked them what connexion with France or its language the house could have, they confessed themselves as frankly baffled and ignorant as I. Archer knew nothing, and all that Miss Harris could say was that an old allusion her grandfather, Dutee Harris, had heard of might have shed a little light."
HPL	"About the period of this work's completion people noticed that the old tool house, tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur's birth, had been abandoned again."
HPL	"So instead of the poems I had hoped for, there came only a shuddering blankness and ineffable loneliness; and I saw at last a fearful truth which no one had ever dared to breathe before the unwhisperable secret of secrets the fact that this city of stone and stridor is not a sentient perpetuation of Old New York as London is of Old London and Paris of Old Paris, but that it is in fact quite dead, its sprawling body imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer animate things which have nothing to do with it as it was in life."
HPL	"""Everybody got aout o' the idee o' dyin' excep' in canoe wars with the other islanders, or as sacrifices to the sea gods daown below, or from snake bite or plague or sharp gallopin' ailments or somethin' afore they cud take to the water but simply looked forrad to a kind o' change that wa'n't a bit horrible arter a while."
HPL	"No ghostly Keziah flitted through the sombre halls and chambers, no small furry thing crept into his dismal eyrie to nuzzle him, and no record of the witch's incantations rewarded his constant search."
HPL	Eliot old Reid was right.
HPL	"Handbills and papers fluttered about filthy gutters; handbills and papers printed in many tongues and in many characters, yet all bearing messages of crime and rebellion."
HPL	"As the shadows gathered, the natives commenced to disperse homeward, anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose."
HPL	"""Remember, I ain't sayin' Obed was set on hevin' things jest like they was on that Kanaky isle."
HPL	"For without warning, in one of the small hours beyond midnight, all the ravages of the years and the storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax; and after the crash there was nothing left standing in The Street save two ancient chimneys and part of a stout brick wall."
HPL	"My own German will no longer controls my acts, and volition is henceforward possible only in minor matters."
HPL	"I heard his repeated shrieks before me, as he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and scrambled madly down the rickety ladders."
HPL	"Had the wind suddenly changed eastward, so that it blew in from the sea and over the town?"
HPL	You have heard of the pineal gland?
HPL	"That afternoon we found the new grave, and determined to begin work soon after midnight."
HPL	As for the Innsmouth people the youth hardly knew what to make of them.
HPL	"Then men in olive drab came, bearing muskets; till it seemed as if in its sad sleep The Street must have some haunting dreams of those other days, when musket bearing men in conical hats walked along it from the woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach."
HPL	It had rested a heavy arm or fore leg on my chest. . . .
HPL	"The rest followed him, and looked curiously at the immense carved door with the now familiar squid dragon bas relief."
HPL	I think I was paralysed for an instant.
HPL	"In the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct, and Gilman felt that the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth dimension."
HPL	"Finally a young man named Vercellius, the son of pure Roman parents, agreed to take us at least past the foothills."
HPL	At last came that which I had long feared.
HPL	"A wind stronger than the night wind rushed by, and I knew that what had befallen St. John must soon befall me."
HPL	"My nervous condition was reflected in my dreams, for I seemed to hear the cries of drowning persons, and to see dead faces pressing against the portholes of the boat."
HPL	"The pallid group in the road, still reeling at the indisputably English syllables that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking altar stone, were never to hear such syllables again."
HPL	"He was a thin, stoop shouldered man not much under six feet tall, dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed grey golf cap."
HPL	"So I tried to read, and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something I found in that accursed Necronomicon; a thought and a legend too hideous for sanity or consciousness."
HPL	And all the while the clamour at the outer door increased.
HPL	"Crazed as I was, I saw in that awful shadow a monstrous resemblance a nauseous, unbelievable caricature a blasphemous effigy of him who had been Denys Barry."
HPL	"And because my fathers had called me to the old town beyond, I pushed on through the shallow, new fallen snow along the road that soared lonely up to where Aldebaran twinkled among the trees; on toward the very ancient town I had never seen but often dreamed of."
HPL	"He injected new blood, joined certain veins, arteries, and nerves at the headless neck, and closed the ghastly aperture with engrafted skin from an unidentified specimen which had borne an officer's uniform."
HPL	"The Great War, through which both of us served as surgeons, had intensified this side of West."
HPL	"The afflicted man was fully conscious, but would say nothing of any consequence; merely muttering such things as ""oh, my ankles"", ""let go"", or ""shut in the tomb""."
HPL	"We lived as recluses; devoid of friends, alone, and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient manor house on a bleak and unfrequented moor; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor."
HPL	"His habitual expression was one of kindly and well bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling within him."
HPL	"In the summer and autumn of I dwelt in the drear expanses of the Cactus Mountains, employed as a common labourer at the celebrated Norton Mine; whose discovery by an aged prospector some years before had turned the surrounding region from a nearly unpeopled waste to a seething cauldron of sordid life."
HPL	"It was a vast undulating plain, mostly covered with seaweed, and strown with the shells of small molluscs."
HPL	"The flutes piped horribly, and again I heard the beating of the drums from the direction of the island ruin."
HPL	"As I began my request the wrinkled satyr like face lost the bored placidity it had possessed during the playing, and seemed to shew the same curious mixture of anger and fright which I had noticed when first I accosted the old man."
HPL	"I must, I saw, trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till I could get out the window and on the roof of the Paine Street block."
HPL	"That cursed, that damnable pit . . ."
HPL	"Had not, then, the riots of those bygone seventeen thirties set moving certain kinetic patterns in the morbid brain of one or more of them notably the sinister Paul Roulet which obscurely survived the bodies murdered and buried by the mob, and continued to function in some multiple dimensioned space along the original lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of the encroaching community?"
HPL	"I do not know just how much of the whole tale has been told even to me, and I have many reasons for not wishing to probe deeper."
HPL	"A wavering flicker of light shewed through my transom, and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load."
HPL	"Then the glass broke shiveringly under the persistent impacts, and the chill wind rushed in, making the candles sputter and rustling the sheets of paper on the table where Zann had begun to write out his horrible secret."
HPL	Undoubtedly he could still manage to walk away from the pull; so with great resolution he headed against it and dragged himself deliberately north along Garrison Street.
HPL	"A very thin sprinkling of repellent looking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalks lone individuals, and silent knots of two or three."
HPL	It is all in that ancestral diary I found; all the hushed innuendoes and furtive tales of things with a blemished eye seen at windows in the night or in deserted meadows near the woods.
HPL	One wolf was seen to lope away unhurt.
HPL	Men looked at one another and muttered.
HPL	Desire to avoid needless explanations in case of unexpected police intrusions prompted these plans for a quiet and unostentatious departure.
HPL	"His drinking, of course, only aggravated what it was meant to alleviate."
HPL	"It was foreign talk, he thought, but he said the bad thing about it was the kind of voice that sometimes spoke."
HPL	"They ate plentifully of fruit and red berries, and marked not the passing of time, but many years must have slipped away."
HPL	"The fishy odour, dispelled for a moment by some merciful breeze, now closed in again with maddening intensity."
HPL	"Her own attitude toward shadowed Innsmouth which she had never seen was one of disgust at a community slipping far down the cultural scale, and she assured me that the rumours of devil worship were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches."
HPL	"Might it not actually be another U boat, offering possibilities of rescue?"
HPL	"Accordingly I had sent a slave a nimble little Greek called Antipater to the proconsul with letters, and Scribonius had heeded my plea and ordered Balbutius to send his fifth cohort, under Asellius, to Pompelo; entering the hills at dusk on the eve of November's Kalends and stamping out whatever nameless orgies he might find bringing such prisoners as he might take to Tarraco for the next proprætor's court."
HPL	Of scepticism there was none.
HPL	"He was certainly near the boundary between the known universe and the fourth dimension, and who could say how much farther he might go?"
HPL	Afterward one sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich.
HPL	"He had read of it with interest, for the paper had told about some strange burrows or passages found in the rocky hill beneath."
HPL	"Half gliding, half floating in the air, the white clad bog wraiths were slowly retreating toward the still waters and the island ruin in fantastic formations suggesting some ancient and solemn ceremonial dance."
HPL	The older matters which had made the sculptor's dream and bas relief so significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript.
HPL	"Then the trees thinned, and far below him on his right he saw the hills and antique roofs and spires of Kingsport."
HPL	"We used to laugh at him, for we knew him from his birth though he thought himself a King's son."
HPL	"""The graoun' was a talkin' lass night, an' towards mornin' Cha'ncey he heerd the whippoorwills so laoud in Col' Spring Glen he couldn't sleep nun."
HPL	"As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go."
HPL	"And they were strange, because they had come as dark furtive folk from opiate southern gardens of orchids, and spoken another tongue before they learnt the tongue of the blue eyed fishers."
HPL	But still these shadows of my dream deride me.
HPL	"He had sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in need of medical aid that Dr. Hartwell was summoned at once."
HPL	"One disgusting canvas seemed to depict a vast cross section of Beacon Hill, with ant like armies of the mephitic monsters squeezing themselves through burrows that honeycombed the ground."
HPL	But then the blow fell.
HPL	"Before I could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street, reeling northward around the ruined warehouse wall."
HPL	He was not his own master.
HPL	"Somewhere, to what remote and fearsome region I know not, Denys Barry has gone."
HPL	"Here, I thought, was the ideal place for a long secret colloquy; so I guided my companion down the lane and picked out spots to sit in among the mossy stones."
HPL	"And out into the limitless aether reeled that fabulous train, the noise of whose shouting was lost in the echoes of thunder."
HPL	"Curiously enough, they seemed to have been chiselled badly out of proportion with their scenic background; for one of the creatures was shewn in the act of killing a whale represented as but little larger than himself."
HPL	It's invisible I knew it would be but there's a powder in this long distance sprayer that might make it shew up for a second.
HPL	"And then I recall how I laughed when I stumbled on the passageway; the hole at the base of the old chimney, where the thick weeds grew and cast queer shadows in the light of the lone candle I had happened to have with me."
HPL	"What the hound was, and why it pursued me, were questions still vague; but I had first heard the baying in that ancient churchyard, and every subsequent event including St. John's dying whisper had served to connect the curse with the stealing of the amulet."
HPL	"Warning me that many of the street signs were down, the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the town's salient features."
HPL	People begun to fall off mills an' shops shet daown shippin' stopped an' the harbour choked up railrud give up but they . . .
HPL	"So taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent laboratory, we left our silent guest on the slab in the dark, and bent every energy to the mixing of a new solution; the weighing and measuring supervised by West with an almost fanatical care."
HPL	"Kuranes had previously entered that abyss only at night, and wondered what it would look like by day; so he watched anxiously as the column approached its brink."
HPL	"Those churches were very odd all violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere, and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments."
HPL	So far I have not shot myself as my uncle Douglas did.
HPL	"That evening he went to bed, but slept only fitfully."
HPL	"Certainly, I look forward impatiently to the sight of that great silver key, for in its cryptical arabesques there may stand symbolised all the aims and mysteries of a blindly impersonal cosmos."
HPL	It is rather fortunate that Elwood was not in Arkham in that later year when certain events abruptly renewed the local whispers about elder horrors.
HPL	"When at last my senses returned, all was frightfully dark, and my mind remembering what had occurred, shrank from the idea of beholding more; yet curiosity overmastered all."
HPL	"I constantly consulted my watch by the light of my electric lantern, and listened with feverish anxiety at the receiver of the telephone; but for more than a quarter of an hour heard nothing."
HPL	"My name and origin need not be related to posterity; in fact, I fancy it is better that they should not be, for when a man suddenly migrates to the States or the Colonies, he leaves his past behind him."
HPL	The blood and soul of the people were as the blood and soul of their ancestors who had fashioned The Street.
HPL	"Without warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which will never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them."
HPL	"I know not how many interminable aeons I sat stupefied; whispering, muttering, calling, screaming into that telephone."
HPL	It was also possible that the inhabitants of a given dimensional realm could survive entry to many unknown and incomprehensible realms of additional or indefinitely multiplied dimensions be they within or outside the given space time continuum and that the converse would be likewise true.
HPL	"About four hours remained for conversation if I were to catch the eight o'clock coach for Arkham, and I began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler; meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch."
HPL	"I now bent to the left around the ruinous green; still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight, and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless, unexplainable beacons."
HPL	"In March, , a gale wrecked the roof and great chimney of the vacant Witch House, so that a chaos of crumbling bricks, blackened, moss grown shingles, and rotting planks and timbers crashed down into the loft and broke through the floor beneath."
HPL	"Williams was a dreamer, and only twenty three, and when he moved into the ancient house he felt a strangeness and a breath of cosmic wind about the grey wizened man in the next room."
HPL	"Upon my memory was graven the vision of the city, and within my soul had arisen another and vaguer recollection, of whose nature I was not then certain."
HPL	"Once I sought out a celebrated ethnologist, and amused him with peculiar questions regarding the ancient Philistine legend of Dagon, the Fish God; but soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional, I did not press my inquiries."
HPL	"Old Man Marsh was never seen, but sometimes went to the works in a closed, curtained car."
HPL	"It seems these Kanakys was sacrificin' heaps o' their young men an' maidens to some kind o' god things that lived under the sea, an' gittin' all kinds o' favour in return."
HPL	"Leading me within, he steered a course in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel path, and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house, which he unlocked and opened for me."
HPL	"And when the red Aldebaran had crawled more than half way around the horizon, there were again darkness and silence."
HPL	"Death fires danced over the tombs, revealing gruesome vistas, though queerly failing to cast any shadows."
HPL	"I should not call that sound a voice, for it was too awful."
HPL	Curtis Whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted.
HPL	"He hailed from Arkham, boarded with a family who came from Ipswich, and went back home whenever he got a moment off."
HPL	His contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of suggested the most valid of reasons.
HPL	"He had cried out in the night, arousing several other artists in the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium."
HPL	"The paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century, when the old castle in which I sat had been a feared and impregnable fortress."
HPL	I felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass.
HPL	How did he know the time when Nahab and her acolyte were due to bear the brimming bowl which would follow the black cock and the black goat?
HPL	"The document, indeed, ended in much confusion; and I was forced to ransack both the Rhode Island Historical Society and Shepley Library before I could find a local door which the name Etienne Roulet would unlock."
HPL	"The bulky leather cover with the brass clasp had been so prominently visible, and the price was so absurdly slight."
HPL	"My Arkham born grandmother had seemed strange and almost terrifying to me, and I do not think I grieved when she disappeared."
HPL	"The walls were of bare boards, and had probably never known plaster; whilst the abundance of dust and cobwebs made the place seem more deserted than inhabited."
HPL	"Unlocking it, he ushered me into a barren hallway with what was once splendid dark oak panelling simple, of course, but thrillingly suggestive of the times of Andros and Phipps and the Witchcraft."
HPL	"Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation."
HPL	"My pressure took the opener off guard, for the thing shut as I pushed, so that I could slip the well conditioned bolt as I had done with the other door."
HPL	"So when I had finished reading I shook my host by the hand, and departed as a friend."
HPL	"Of its nature, and manner of coming into my possession, I cannot speak."
HPL	"The witchcraft terror is a horrible ray of light on what was stewing in men's crushed brains, but even that is a trifle."
HPL	This need for very fresh corpses had been West's moral undoing.
HPL	Great excitement once came to The Street.
HPL	There it still stood on the night I dug in Jan Martense's grave.
HPL	"Several swimmers were still discernible; while on the far black reef I could see a faint, steady glow unlike the winking beacon visible before, and of a curious colour which I could not precisely identify."
HPL	"As Wilcox would have said, the geometry of the place was all wrong."
HPL	"Their life was exceedingly secluded, and people declared that their isolation had made them heavy of speech and comprehension."
HPL	"I will quote the following account of the star Nova Persei verbatim from the pages of that eminent astronomical authority, Prof. Garrett P. Serviss: ""On February , , a marvellous new star was discovered by Dr. Anderson, of Edinburgh, not very far from Algol."
HPL	Then suddenly all thoughts of time were blotted out by an onrushing image of sharp intensity and unaccountable horror which had seized me before I knew what it really was.
HPL	"Though these stately old avenues were ill surfaced and unkempt, their elm shaded dignity had not entirely departed."
HPL	"You call the Salem witchcraft a delusion, but I'll wage my four times great grandmother could have told you things."
HPL	"At one time he threatened to abandon the expedition if I remained insistent; a threat which proved effective, since he alone held the key to the thing."
HPL	"We were aged and weak from our drugs, dissipations, and nervous overstrain, and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become snow white."
HPL	"Besides human tissue, West employed much of the reptile embryo tissue which he had cultivated with such singular results."
HPL	"I myself had just alighted from a litter, which the Illyrian bearers seemed to have brought in some haste from Calagurris, across the Iberus to the southward."
HPL	"The bog was the cause of all these troubles, as Barry told me the night I came to the castle."
HPL	Snow would have hid the rails in any case.
HPL	"All around him was cloud and chaos, and he could see nothing below but the whiteness of illimitable space."
HPL	"Muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached, and at length a firm knock came at my outer door."
HPL	They seemed sullenly banded together in some sort of fellowship and understanding despising the world as if they had access to other and preferable spheres of entity.
HPL	I shuddered as the man grew colloquial and with familiar speech of another day.
HPL	"Young Wilcox's rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly characteristic of him."
HPL	"Of how the organic entities moved, he could tell no more than of how he moved himself."
HPL	"The things we saw were very old and marvellous, or at least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which I viewed them, and I shall never forget the tottering Ionic columns and fluted pilasters and urn headed iron fence posts and flaring lintelled windows and decorative fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity."
HPL	I seem to ramble along without much Logick or Continuity when I endeavour to recall the Past; and fear I light upon but few Incidents which others have not before discuss'd.
HPL	"Whether I shall go as he did remains to be seen, for I have learned much now."
HPL	Later I might sift the tale and extract some nucleus of historic allegory; just now I wished to put it out of my head.
HPL	"As I stood pondering with my hand on the now useless switch I heard a muffled creaking on the floor below, and thought I could barely distinguish voices in conversation."
HPL	"And before he died, Taran Ish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes the sign of DOOM."
HPL	"But now his oversensitive ears caught something behind him, and he looked back across the level terrace."
HPL	"And since spirit, in order to cause all the manifestations attributed to it, cannot be limited by any of the laws of matter; why is it extravagant to imagine psychically living dead things in shapes or absences of shapes which must for human spectators be utterly and appallingly ""unnamable""?"
HPL	"I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me."
HPL	"Flutes shrieked and drums began to beat, and as I watched in awe and terror I thought I saw dark saltant forms silhouetted grotesquely against the vision of marble and effulgence."
HPL	"Young Galpin, the fiancé in question, had been one of Appleton's most remarkable sons."
HPL	"If this man could not be restored to life, no one would know of our experiment."
HPL	But most of all did he dwell upon some mysterious blazing entity that shook and laughed and mocked at him.
HPL	"So Carter bought stranger books and sought out deeper and more terrible men of fantastic erudition; delving into arcana of consciousness that few have trod, and learning things about the secret pits of life, legend, and immemorial antiquity which disturbed him ever afterward."
HPL	Dangers he met unflinchingly; crimes he committed unmoved.
HPL	"Knowing little of the art myself, I was yet certain that none of his harmonies had any relation to music I had heard before; and concluded that he was a composer of highly original genius."
HPL	"At last the French element had appeared that, and another deeper element of horror which the name conjured up from the darkest recesses of my weird and heterogeneous reading and I feverishly studied the platting of the locality as it had been before the cutting through and partial straightening of Back Street between and ."
HPL	"They say he still wears clothes, but he'll take to the water soon."
HPL	"Into the granite city of Teloth wandered the youth, vine crowned, his yellow hair glistening with myrrh and his purple robe torn with briers of the mountain Sidrak that lies across the antique bridge of stone."
HPL	"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents."
HPL	"""It took Obed to git the truth aout o' them heathen."
HPL	This I perceived with unhealthy sharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were violently assailed.
HPL	"In this walk, so many times repeated, the world's greatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to pass a particular house on the eastern side of the street; a dingy, antiquated structure perched on the abruptly rising side hill, with a great unkempt yard dating from a time when the region was partly open country."
HPL	"Evidently some blight or distemper, perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the Whateley animals."
HPL	"At my evident ignorance of his meaning, the pitchy eyes once more flashed malevolently at me, until, helpless as I saw my opponent to be, I trembled as I watched him."
HPL	"If they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they instantly flutter away chittering in daemoniac laughter; but if they fail, they subside gradually into a disappointed silence."
HPL	"The crone now motioned him to hold the bowl in a certain position while she raised the huge, grotesque knife above the small white victim as high as her right hand could reach."
HPL	"I never learned its title, for the early pages were missing; but it fell open toward the end and gave me a glimpse of something which sent my senses reeling."
HPL	"The light of the moon had strangely failed, and as Atal plunged upward through the mists he heard Barzai the Wise shrieking in the shadows: ""The moon is dark, and the gods dance in the night; there is terror in the sky, for upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books of men or of earth's gods. . . ."
HPL	"If, on the other hand, he could be restored, our fame would be brilliantly and perpetually established."
HPL	"The older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt handed down through a long line of mystical experimenters."
HPL	"The bones of the tiny paws, it is rumoured, imply prehensile characteristics more typical of a diminutive monkey than of a rat; while the small skull with its savage yellow fangs is of the utmost anomalousness, appearing from certain angles like a miniature, monstrously degraded parody of a human skull."
HPL	"For some distance the line kept on along the gorge's brink, but at length I reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzy height."
HPL	"They glistened bloated and green in the moonbeams, and seemed to gaze up at the fount of light."
HPL	The following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur's first trip outside the Dunwich region.
HPL	And there were cobblestones over which clattered many a blooded horse and rumbled many a gilded coach; and brick sidewalks with horse blocks and hitching posts.
HPL	"Disintegration is quite painless, I assure you but I want you to see them."
HPL	"Lest you think me a biassed witness, another's pen must add this final testimony, which may perhaps supply the climax you expect."
HPL	Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop of the undecayed Bishops mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked.
HPL	"They shewed the visitor the grave, barren and devoid of markers."
HPL	"I had not seen him since that day, two months and a half before, when he had told me toward what goal his physical and metaphysical researches were leading; when he had answered my awed and almost frightened remonstrances by driving me from his laboratory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage."
HPL	"Two hundred years and more they have leaned or squatted there, while the vines have crawled and the trees have swelled and spread."
HPL	"He spoke, too, of that Edmund Carter who had just escaped hanging in the Salem witchcraft, and who had placed in an antique box a great silver key handed down from his ancestors."
HPL	"""He shall not drink He shall not drink"" Thus roared Old Bugs as he seemed to run out of or rise above quotations."
HPL	"But here, too, was there no satisfaction or fulfilment; for the touch of earth was upon his mind, and he could not think of lovely things as he had done of yore."
HPL	"Then came a noxious rush of noisome, frigid air from that same dreaded direction, followed by a piercing shriek just beside me on that shocking rifted tomb of man and monster."
HPL	"The space south of the house, abutting on Benefit Street, was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level, forming a terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp, mossy stone pierced by a steep flight of narrow steps which led inward between canyon like surfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn, rheumy brick walls, and neglected gardens whose dismantled cement urns, rusted kettles fallen from tripods of knotty sticks, and similar paraphernalia set off the weather beaten front door with its broken fanlight, rotting Ionic pilasters, and wormy triangular pediment."
HPL	"In short, it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house; traceable to one or another of the ill favoured French settlers of two centuries before, and still operative through rare and unknown laws of atomic and electronic motion."
HPL	"But though the dreaded Martenses were gone, the fear of the haunted house continued; and grew very acute when new and strange stories arose among the mountain decadents."
HPL	"But still I read more in hidden, forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led me and pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and life patterns toward the core of the unknown cosmos."
HPL	"Davis, an old time village practitioner, had of course seen both at the respective funerals, as indeed he had attended both Fenner and Sawyer in their last illnesses."
HPL	An acetylene gas outfit gave the light necessary for work.
HPL	"Not that I had any real apprehension of its need, but that any symbol of security was welcome in an environment of this kind."
HPL	This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed Professor Angell.
HPL	"It remained unvisited till , when the continued absence of lights was noticed by the squatters."
HPL	"Curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution, and in my youthful egotism I fancied I might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused, extravagant outpouring I would probably extract with the aid of raw whiskey."
HPL	"Shrouded in mist they were, so that no man might peer beyond them or see their summits which indeed some say reach even to the heavens."
HPL	"They never did quite figure out what the trouble was, but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from China or somewhere by the shipping."
HPL	"In the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the local draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men fit even to be sent to a development camp."
HPL	"This was to be my realm, too I could not escape it."
HPL	"Still and somnolent did it lie, on a strange plateau in a hollow betwixt strange peaks."
HPL	The remaining two had gone back wordlessly to their mountains and this autumn not a single villager had disappeared.
HPL	"This object was the partly crushed skeleton of a huge, diseased rat, whose abnormalities of form are still a topic of debate and source of singular reticence among the members of Miskatonic's department of comparative anatomy."
HPL	"That some hideous animal must be the cause, everyone quickly agreed; nor did any tongue now revive the charge that such cryptic deaths formed merely the sordid murders common in decadent communities."
HPL	"Moreover, he had in the past secretly studied the theory of reanimation to some extent under West."
HPL	"Then, when he was free, he felt in his blouse pocket for the key; and being reassured, skipped off across the orchard to the rise beyond, where the wooded hill climbed again to heights above even the treeless knoll."
HPL	"The alienists listened with keen attention to his words, since their curiosity had been aroused to a high pitch by the suggestive yet mostly conflicting and incoherent stories of his family and neighbours."
HPL	"Klenze's ivory image, but the sight of an automatic pistol calmed them."
HPL	"In the darkness I raised my free hand and tested the barrier, finding it stone and immovable."
HPL	"After that I lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle, and was reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back booted and dressed in a loose antique costume, and sat down on that very bench, so that I could not see him."
HPL	"But now Zadok was shaking me, and I turned back to watch the melting of that fear frozen face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums."
HPL	It was not long before I found that Zann's eagerness for my company was not as great as it had seemed while he was persuading me to move down from the fifth story.
HPL	"On the faces of men were frowns, but by the stone embankment along the sluggish river Zuro sate a young boy with sad eyes gazing into the waters to spy green budding branches washed down from the hills by the freshets."
HPL	"Of the various tales that of aged Soames, the family butler, is most ample and coherent."
HPL	"It may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced one of the men, an excitable Spaniard, to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror."
HPL	"Subsequent terror drove them from my mind, but I think the last one, which I repeated, was: ""Where have you been?"""
HPL	"As my grand uncle's heir and executor, for he died a childless widower, I was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston."
HPL	"Country and village people, however, canvassed the place with infinite care; overturning everything in the house, sounding ponds and brooks, beating down bushes, and ransacking the nearby forests."
HPL	"One must not, for example, linger much around the Marsh refinery, or around any of the still used churches, or around the pillared Order of Dagon Hall at New Church Green."
HPL	"The situation was almost past management, and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to handle."
HPL	"It was about two feet square, and bore West's correct name and present address."
HPL	"I followed his glance, and beheld just above us on the loose plaster of the ancient ceiling a large irregular spot of wet crimson which seemed to spread even as I viewed it."
HPL	The Scream of the Dead The scream of a dead man gave to me that acute and added horror of Dr. Herbert West which harassed the latter years of our companionship.
HPL	What I saw about me none else saw; and I grew doubly silent and aloof lest I be thought mad.
HPL	"Strangers and Tegeans stood aghast, looking from the wreckage to the great, sinister tree whose aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the sculptured sepulchre of Kalos."
HPL	"Yes, Thurber, I decided long ago that one must paint terror as well as beauty from life, so I did some exploring in places where I had reason to know terror lives."
HPL	I have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness. . . .
HPL	"Little things make considerable excitement in little towns, which is the reason that Kingsport people talked all that spring and summer about the three unidentifiable bodies, horribly slashed as with many cutlasses, and horribly mangled as by the tread of many cruel boot heels, which the tide washed in."
HPL	"As before, he dreamed first of the village that was asleep or dead, and of the abyss down which one must float silently; then the rift appeared again, and he beheld the glittering minarets of the city, and saw the graceful galleys riding at anchor in the blue harbour, and watched the gingko trees of Mount Aran swaying in the sea breeze."
HPL	"""Glad ta see ye, young Sir new faces is scurce arount here, an' I hain't got much ta cheer me up these days."
HPL	"Of the midnight storm which destroyed this gloomy mansion, the older inhabitants of the region sometimes speak in hushed and uneasy voices; alluding to what they call ""divine wrath"" in a manner that in later years vaguely increased the always strong fascination which I felt for the forest darkened sepulchre."
HPL	"I experienced some shame at my susceptibility to so slight a thing, but the drawing nevertheless disturbed me, especially in connexion with some adjacent passages descriptive of Anzique gastronomy."
HPL	That this could be accomplished without loss of life was in many cases conceivable.
HPL	As the dead man was thrown overboard there occurred two incidents which created much disturbance amongst the crew.
HPL	"The chanted ritual was not the secret that was never spoken aloud, only whispered."
HPL	"Of the various odd assemblages in The Street, the law said much but could prove little."
HPL	all over the reef an' swimmin' up the harbour into the Manuxet. . . .
HPL	"Then suddenly all the stars were blotted from the sky even bright Deneb and Vega ahead, and the lone Altair and Fomalhaut behind us."
HPL	On this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a Sime or an Angarola could paint.
HPL	"To credit these whisperings of rural grandmothers, I now insisted, argued a faith in the existence of spectral substances on the earth apart from and subsequent to their material counterparts."
HPL	"""Used to be talk of a queer foreign kind of jewellery that the sailors and refinery men sometimes sold on the sly, or that was seen once or twice on some of the Marsh womenfolks."
HPL	"The line put forth no branches, and Arthur was the last of it."
HPL	"It spread over the old man, too, whether from the same source or because of his fear and vehemence, and I saw him shrivel and blacken as he lurched near and strove to rend me with vulturine talons."
HPL	"Opening the door, he saw that the flour on the corridor floor was undisturbed except for the huge prints of the loutish fellow who roomed at the other end of the garret."
HPL	"They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky."
HPL	"The tracks on the flooring were certainly vastly unlike the average prints of a rat, but even Choynski and Desrochers would not admit that they were like the prints of four tiny human hands."
HPL	"For the moment his recollections were hopelessly hazy, but he knew at least that he must have been sleep walking."
HPL	"Finally the connecting door gave, but with such a crash that I knew those outside must have heard."
HPL	"After an hour his furtive taciturnity shewed signs of disappearing, but much to my disappointment he still sidetracked my questions about Innsmouth and its shadow haunted past."
HPL	"His hands were large and heavily veined, and had a very unusual greyish blue tinge."
HPL	"This, acting on my imagination, had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed, shambling form beneath it."
HPL	"The day was pleasant, but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy ravines of the stricken region."
HPL	"We shall overleap time, space, and dimensions, and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation."
HPL	"Flight was universal, and in the clamour and panic several fell in a swoon and were dragged away by their madly fleeing companions."
HPL	"How often hath he sung to me of lands that never were, and things that never can be Of Aira did he speak much; of Aira and the river Nithra, and the falls of the tiny Kra."
HPL	I do not think that many of Sheehan's regular patrons will ever forget the day that young Alfred Trever came.
HPL	"In ordered terraces rose the green banks, adorned here and there with bowers of vines and sweet blossoms, and seats and benches of marble and porphyry."
HPL	"We now had a studio in London, never separating, but never discussing the days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world."
HPL	"My back was toward the fishy smelling sea, but he was facing it, and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low, distant line of Devil Reef, then shewing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves."
HPL	"I will not deny, though my memory is uncertain and indistinct, that this witness of yours may have seen us together as he says, on the Gainesville pike, walking toward Big Cypress Swamp, at half past eleven on that awful night."
HPL	"Dogs abhorred the boy, and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menace."
HPL	"I knew that I could not accost him then and there, for the firemen would surely notice and object."
HPL	"It had four inch horns, but a face and jaw something like yours and mine."""
HPL	"So thick were the vapours that the way was hard, and though Atal followed on at last, he could scarce see the grey shape of Barzai on the dim slope above in the clouded moonlight."
HPL	"And on the thirty first day that we followed the bird, we beheld the basalt pillars of the West."
HPL	There he worked like a butcher in the midst of his gory wares I could never get used to the levity with which he handled and classified certain things.
HPL	Such a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility in the light of a newer science which includes the theories of relativity and intra atomic action.
HPL	"Unseen things not of earth or at least not of tri dimensional earth rushed foetid and horrible through New England's glens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain tops."
HPL	"""Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd,"" the voice choked out."
HPL	"I talked with the elderly Archer Harris, then owner of the house, many times before his death in ; and obtained from him and his still surviving maiden sister Alice an authentic corroboration of all the family data my uncle had collected."
HPL	I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent disturbance of an old man's peace of mind.
HPL	"And the soldiers at Jaren laughed at me and drave me out, so that I wandered to many other cities."
HPL	"There was a cavernous fireplace and a spinning wheel at which a bent old woman in loose wrapper and deep poke bonnet sat back toward me, silently spinning despite the festive season."
HPL	"The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that this sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility."
HPL	"By the time I came of age, I had made a small clearing in the thicket before the mould stained facade of the hillside, allowing the surrounding vegetation to encircle and overhang the space like the walls and roof of a sylvan bower."
HPL	It was Ann White who first gave definite shape to the sinister idle talk.
HPL	"At last I could feel a real shiver run through Manton, who had moved very near."
HPL	"Clocks time space infinity and then my fancy reverted to the local as I reflected that even now, beyond the roof and the fog and the rain and the atmosphere, Corona Borealis was rising in the northeast."
HPL	"Once my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit, with a crowd of angry faces framed by straggling locks and three cornered hats frowning down on him."
HPL	"The crouching image with its cuttlefish head, dragon body, scaly wings, and hieroglyphed pedestal, was preserved in the Museum at Hyde Park; and I studied it long and well, finding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship, and with the same utter mystery, terrible antiquity, and unearthly strangeness of material which I had noted in Legrasse's smaller specimen."
HPL	"Upon the usurpation of Vitiges, Ibidus fell into disgrace and was for a time imprisoned; but the coming of the Byzantine Roman army under Belisarius soon restored him to liberty and honours."
HPL	"Certainly, it had much to do with something in the book which Warren carried with him that ancient book in undecipherable characters which had come to him from India a month before but I swear I do not know what it was that we expected to find."
HPL	"It was a peaceful Arcadian scene, but knowing what it hid I hated it."
HPL	"I found, at the start, that the land had been part of the long strip of home lot granted originally to John Throckmorton; one of many similar strips beginning at the Town Street beside the river and extending up over the hill to a line roughly corresponding with the modern Hope Street."
HPL	"From whatever direction the daemon might come, our potential escape was provided."
HPL	"At times her screams became insupportable, and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors which necessitated her son's temporary residence with his cousin, Peleg Harris, in Presbyterian Lane near the new college building."
HPL	In the end I did find something; something of such vague but monstrous import that I set about at once to examine the cellar of the shunned house itself with a new and excited minuteness.
HPL	"Suddenly the urn to which I clung began to tremble, as if sharing my own lethal dizziness; and in another instant my body was plunging downward to I knew not what fate."
HPL	"Nor did they like the strange sculptures upon the grey monoliths of Ib, for those sculptures were terrible with great antiquity."
HPL	"Some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough, but there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious great grandmother which my uncle was almost reluctant to produce."
HPL	Had there been a noise I had not heard?
HPL	"The Sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is more ancient than the Sphinx, and remembers that which she hath forgotten."
HPL	"On the morning of April a fresh rat hole appeared in the room where Gilman was a guest, but Dombrowski tinned it up during the day."
HPL	"So Carter had tried to do as others did, and pretended that the common events and emotions of earthy minds were more important than the fantasies of rare and delicate souls."
HPL	But Romero did not reply.
HPL	"Better still, though, he would utilise only two boxes of the base to support the superstructure, leaving one free to be piled on top in case the actual feat of escape required an even greater altitude."
HPL	"He did not respond, and still the viol shrieked on without slackening."
HPL	"Reason, logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded."
HPL	"Old Michel was said to have burnt his wife alive as a sacrifice to the Devil, and the unaccountable disappearances of many small peasant children were laid at the dreaded door of these two."
HPL	"If this were so, I would have to make my retreat across country away from any road; but how could I do that in view of the marshy and creek riddled nature of all the surrounding region?"
HPL	No sooner had the venerable practitioner saved his colleague than he himself succumbed to the grim enemy he had fought.
HPL	"Ever since his son had commenced to grow out of infancy he had liked his home less and less, till at last he had seemed to dread it."
HPL	"Geological considerations had dictated an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest part of the subterranean area; and the belief of the Superintendent that only solid rock would be encountered, had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite."
HPL	"And when he had failed to find these boons in things whose laws are known and measurable, they told him he lacked imagination, and was immature because he preferred dream illusions to the illusions of our physical creation."
HPL	"One night as I listened to the discourse in the large square containing many statues, I felt a change; and perceived that I had at last a bodily form."
HPL	"Over the seas there was a great victory, and in triumph most of the young men returned."
HPL	"I hear a noise at the door, as of some immense slippery body lumbering against it."
HPL	"When we rose to the surface about sunset a seaman's body was found on the deck, hands gripping the railing in curious fashion."
HPL	"As twilight deepened I turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap, iron framed bed, and tried as best I could to continue the reading I had begun."
HPL	"For a time Mercy could secure no more help, since the seven deaths and case of madness, all occurring within five years' space, had begun to set in motion the body of fireside rumour which later became so bizarre."
HPL	"The small paned windows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung round the precarious panelling, shaky interior shutters, peeling wall paper, falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered furniture as still remained."
HPL	"Urged on by an impulse which I cannot definitely analyse, I scrambled with difficulty down the rocks and stood on the gentler slope beneath, gazing into the Stygian deeps where no light had yet penetrated."
HPL	"It was not what I heard, but what I saw; for in that dark, locked, shuttered, and curtained room there appeared from the black northeast corner a shaft of horrible red gold light a shaft which bore with it no glow to disperse the darkness, but which streamed only upon the recumbent head of the troubled sleeper, bringing out in hideous duplication the luminous and strangely youthful memory face as I had known it in dreams of abysmal space and unshackled time, when my friend had pushed behind the barrier to those secret, innermost, and forbidden caverns of nightmare."
HPL	"The villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy; and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death, they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard."
HPL	I cannot see a well or a subway entrance without shuddering . . .
HPL	"At certain stages of the ritual they did grovelling obeisance, especially when he held above his head that abhorrent Necronomicon he had taken with him; and I shared all the obeisances because I had been summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers."
HPL	"Manton remained thoughtful as I said this, but gradually reverted to his analytical mood."
HPL	"Fool that I was to plunge with such unsanctioned phrensy into mysteries no man was meant to penetrate; fool or god that he was my only friend, who led me and went before me, and who in the end passed into terrors which may yet be mine."
HPL	Or were the townsfolk really so resentful about curious visitors?
HPL	"And old folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing there, and of laughter that swells with joys beyond earth's joys; and say that at evening the little low windows are brighter than formerly."
HPL	"Put back the slab and run there's nothing else you or anyone can do now"" The tone changed again, this time acquiring a softer quality, as of hopeless resignation."
HPL	"Having lost these artificial settings, their lives grew void of direction and dramatic interest; till at length they strove to drown their ennui in bustle and pretended usefulness, noise and excitement, barbaric display and animal sensation."
HPL	"He talked of death incessantly, but laughed hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements were gently suggested."
HPL	"Besides, he was almost sure that nothing can be really ""unnamable""."
HPL	"His haousekeeper Sally was carryin' on fit ter kill she'd jest seed the trees a bendin' beside the rud, an' says they was a kind o' mushy saound, like a elephant puffin' an' treadin', a headin' fer the haouse."
HPL	"The region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute, substantially unknown and untraversed by white men."
HPL	"To me Alos denied a warrior's part, for I was feeble and given to strange faintings when subjected to stress and hardships."
HPL	"However this may be, it is certain that they worshipped a sea green stone idol chiselled in the likeness of Bokrug, the great water lizard; before which they danced horribly when the moon was gibbous."
HPL	"But not wantin' to bother, they'd lay low when anybody visited the island."
HPL	"And the cities of Cathuria are cinctured with golden walls, and their pavements also are of gold."
HPL	"But with their marvelling was mixed hate, for they thought it not meet that beings of such aspect should walk about the world of men at dusk."
HPL	"Olney does not recall many of the wonders he told, or even who he was; but says that he was strange and kindly, and filled with the magic of unfathomed voids of time and space."
HPL	"During her brief stay at Jermyn House she occupied a remote wing, and was waited on by her husband alone."
HPL	"As the naiads neared the bog, without altering their course, a new line of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some door far below my window, groped sightlessly across the courtyard and through the intervening bit of village, and joined the floundering column of labourers on the plain."
HPL	"It was acutely uncanny, even when frightful and uncanny things were common, to encounter so blankly clueless a scene after such overwhelming occurrences; and we moved about beneath the leaden, darkening sky with that tragic directionless zeal which results from a combined sense of futility and necessity of action."
HPL	"Scarcely had I crossed the sill when there descended upon the whole company a sudden and unheralded fear of hideous intensity, distorting every face and evoking the most horrible screams from nearly every throat."
HPL	"Get bald, too, very young."
HPL	"The really inexplicable thing was the way in which the victims ignorant people, for the ill smelling and widely shunned house could now be rented to no others would babble maledictions in French, a language they could not possibly have studied to any extent."
HPL	"There was no ship visible, as I had half expected there would be."
HPL	"There had been a gorgeous sunset, and now the moon came up, nearly full and shedding a silver flood over the plain, the distant mountainside, and the curious low mounds that rose here and there."
HPL	Others thought and still think he'd found an old pirate cache out on Devil Reef.
HPL	Armington helped Birch to the outside of a spare bed and sent his little son Edwin for Dr. Davis.
HPL	"Our situation had suddenly become grave indeed; for though the chemical air regenerators were intact, and though we could use the devices for raising and submerging the ship and opening the hatches as long as compressed air and storage batteries might hold out, we were powerless to propel or guide the submarine."
HPL	"Examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum, my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones."
HPL	"All of this material I cannot hope to give, for my uncle was a tireless antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house; but I may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by their recurrence through many reports from diverse sources."
HPL	"What had come had indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming, now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded unmistakably from within."
HPL	"There was a suggestion of sound, too, though the wind was blowing the other way a suggestion of bestial scraping and bellowing even worse than the muttering of the parties I had lately overheard."
HPL	"Reading the life of Theseus, I was much impressed by that passage telling of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to find his tokens of destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift its enormous weight."
HPL	"I s'pose it's cheap enough, but I never see more'n two or three people in it nobody but those Innsmouth folks."
HPL	"At the end of the corridor was a bathroom a discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl, tin tub, faint electric light, and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures."
HPL	"It was the Terrible Season of the autumn, and the wild people in the mountains were preparing for the frightful ceremonies which only rumour told of in the towns."
HPL	"This, I knew, must be Devil Reef."
HPL	"It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle."
HPL	"There's poetry in this sort of thing, you know or perhaps you don't know, but it's all the same."""
HPL	"It was a painful process, and at its very start brought out a fresh and disconcerting fact."
HPL	"Waterfront scum was far too common for special mention; though there was vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made, during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant hills."
HPL	"It is truly a terrible thing, and unmistakably akin to the dream sculpture of young Wilcox."
HPL	"I did not exactly relish the task, for the atmosphere of the Williamson home had always depressed me."
HPL	"Here he found a shady road to Arkham, but no trail at all in the seaward direction he wished."
HPL	Nothing can be put back now.
HPL	"The men were not pleased at his punishment, but discipline was necessary."
HPL	"None of the non natives ever stayed out late at night, there being a widespread impression that it was not wise to do so."
HPL	"A weird bunch of cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with which I set them aside."
HPL	"Their social contacts grew fewer and fewer, till at last they took to intermarrying with the numerous menial class about the estate."
HPL	"About this period his inability to concentrate on his formal studies worried him considerably, his apprehensions about the mid year examinations being very acute."
HPL	"I hardly know how to continue, since conditions so singular are involved; but I will do my best, not even trying to differentiate betwixt the real and the apparent."
HPL	"What I wished was a comprehensive history of the site from its very settlement in or even before, if any Narragansett Indian legend could be unearthed to supply the data."
HPL	"The door on the north was hung to open away from me, and this though a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the other side I knew must be my route."
HPL	"They wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again."""
HPL	"The ground under one of the squatters' villages had caved in after a lightning stroke, destroying several of the malodorous shanties; but upon this property damage was superimposed an organic devastation which paled it to insignificance."
HPL	"All the same his crews ud git a piece an' dispose of it naow and then, even though they was swore to keep quiet; an' he let his women folks wear some o' the pieces as was more human like than most."
HPL	"We had all been rather jovial, and West and I did not wish to have our pugnacious companion hunted down."
HPL	With one savage kick he sent the morbidity over the edge of the gulf and heard it whimper on some level far below.
HPL	I did not like those rumours of a fight which were floating about.
HPL	"Its construction, over a century and a half ago, had followed the grading and straightening of the road in that especial vicinity; for Benefit Street at first called Back Street was laid out as a lane winding amongst the graveyards of the first settlers, and straightened only when the removal of the bodies to the North Burial Ground made it decently possible to cut through the old family plots."
HPL	"Those who took down their receivers heard a fright mad voice shriek out, ""Help, oh, my Gawd . ."
HPL	"On the morning of July we sighted a warship flying American colours, and the men became very restless in their desire to surrender."
HPL	"That glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out from an accidental piecing together of separated things in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of a dead professor."
HPL	"The strangeness did not reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds."
HPL	"Presently the two people simply villagers, apparently farthest in the lead saw me and stood paralysed."
HPL	"The pile of tools soon reached, and a hammer and chisel selected, Birch returned over the coffins to the door."
HPL	"Nevertheless I followed him; for in those dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that I had to keep my soul alive, and I reckoned it a rare favour of Fate to fall in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much farther than mine."
HPL	"At midnight the doorbell rang, startling him fearfully."
HPL	"After midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandaemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside, and not until dawn did they finally quiet down."
HPL	The light seemed now to be more like a rain or hail of small violet particles than like a continuous beam.
HPL	"Gilman was half involuntarily moving about in the twilight abysses with the bubble mass and the small polyhedron floating ahead, when he noticed the peculiarly regular angles formed by the edges of some gigantic neighbouring prism clusters."
HPL	"But again I thought of the emptiness and horror of reality, and boldly prepared to follow whithersoever I might be led."
HPL	"The old seaman, who had survived his son Welcome's death in battle by two years, had not himself known the legend; but recalled that his earliest nurse, the ancient Maria Robbins, seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weird significance to the French ravings of Rhoby Harris, which she had so often heard during the last days of that hapless woman."
HPL	"All hees own housework he do hees leetle room are full of bottles and machines, and he do not work as doctair."
HPL	"Now, he reflected, those nervous fears were being mirrored in his disordered dreams."
HPL	"My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in increasing perturbation and with eyes that had now started open, seemed not one but many men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself."
HPL	"He had protested then, when they had found him, waked him, and carried him home, for just as he was aroused he had been about to sail in a golden galley for those alluring regions where the sea meets the sky."
HPL	"Less than a week after our return to England, strange things began to happen."
HPL	"A moment later I felt less sure that the deeper sounds were voices, since the apparent hoarse barkings and loose syllabled croakings bore so little resemblance to recognised human speech."
HPL	"The whole attic story was choked with debris from above, but no one took the trouble to touch the mess before the inevitable razing of the decrepit structure."
HPL	"And in the autumn of the year, when the winds from the north curse and whine, and the red leaved trees of the swamp mutter things to one another in the small hours of the morning under the horned waning moon, I sit by the casement and watch that star."
HPL	For a moment I half doubted that I had ever seen it in the more definitely limned form but then I thought of the legends.
HPL	"Most distinctly Birch was lax, insensitive, and professionally undesirable; yet I still think he was not an evil man."
HPL	"He had, Elwood said, shewed no tendency to talk or rise in his sleep; and meanwhile the landlord was putting rat poison everywhere."
HPL	"It might be in the visible world, yet it might be only in his mind and soul."
HPL	"For a moment I saw nothing save a myriad of tiny dancing lights, far, far before me."
HPL	"Attaining distinction as a boy through his wonderful mentality, he won vast fame at the University of Wisconsin, and at the age of twenty three returned to Appleton to take up a professorship at Lawrence and to slip a diamond upon the finger of Appleton's fairest and most brilliant daughter."
HPL	"Human utterance can best convey the general character of our experiences by calling them plungings or soarings; for in every period of revelation some part of our minds broke boldly away from all that is real and present, rushing aërially along shocking, unlighted, and fear haunted abysses, and occasionally tearing through certain well marked and typical obstacles describable only as viscous, uncouth clouds or vapours."
HPL	"Thick, well trimmed hair that argued the punctual calls of a barber was parted gracefully above a high forehead; and the whole picture was one of striking intelligence and superior blood and breeding."
HPL	After that I went to Sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of the vice admiralty court.
HPL	"Furtiveness and secretiveness seemed universal in this hushed city of alienage and death, and I could not escape the sensation of being watched from ambush on every hand by sly, staring eyes that never shut."
HPL	Watch me in the sky close by the Daemon Star.
HPL	"An eye for an eye Great heavens, Birch, but you got what you deserved."
HPL	Bizarre manifestations were now too frequent to count.
HPL	"I now felt the floor of this lower room giving as that of the upper chamber had done, and once a crashing above had been followed by the fall past the west window of something which must have been the cupola."
HPL	"Fancying now that I had attained the very pinnacle of the castle, I commenced to rush up the few steps beyond the door; but the sudden veiling of the moon by a cloud caused me to stumble, and I felt my way more slowly in the dark."
HPL	"Instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns, for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken, and I once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally tri dimensional."
HPL	"Then a faint clicking came from the instrument, and I called down to my friend in a tense voice."
HPL	"Aghast, I turned to examine the charred and shrivelled figure on the floor."
HPL	"His questioning grew more than medically tense, and his hands shook as he dressed the mangled members; binding them as if he wished to get the wounds out of sight as quickly as possible."
HPL	"He considered it an obligation to his ward to make the most of all the boy's property, nor did he concern himself with the deaths and illnesses which caused so many changes of tenants, or the steadily growing aversion with which the house was generally regarded."
HPL	"Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which to escape them."
HPL	"Dombrowski called her, and she waddled in."
HPL	"Viscous obstacles were clawed through in rapid succession, and at length I felt that we had been borne to realms of greater remoteness than any we had previously known."
HPL	"Don't worry, they won't hurt you."
HPL	It must have been midnight at least when Birch decided he could get through the transom.
HPL	"He fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels, after a careless push from a negro sailor."
HPL	But West's gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties.
HPL	How such a sound could have been heard in the last few hours without arousing all the Miskatonic Valley was more than the honest physician could say.
HPL	"There was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and half finished monstrosities that leered around from every side of the room, and when Pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light I could not for my life keep back a loud scream the second I had emitted that night."
HPL	"Before the marble walls on the appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of travellers, and all the shore resounded with the song of happy revellers."
HPL	"The fellow's eyes had been closed; but in the dragging of his body to the rail they were jarred open, and many seemed to entertain a queer delusion that they gazed steadily and mockingly at Schmidt and Zimmer, who were bent over the corpse."
HPL	"They had talked about dying and half deserted Innsmouth for nearly a century, and nothing new could be wilder or more hideous than what they had whispered and hinted years before."
HPL	"He dreaded to cross the bridge that gave a view of the desolate island in the Miskatonic, so went over the Peabody Avenue bridge."
HPL	"Quickly he said, ""It's the finish but let's incinerate this."""
HPL	"Believing him just conscious after a fainting fit, I renewed my rapping, at the same time calling out my name reassuringly."
HPL	"When tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the Elder Ones, then great eager mists flock to heaven laden with lore, and oceanward eyes on the rocks see only a mystic whiteness, as if the cliff's rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of buoys tolled free in the aether of faery."
HPL	"The title of the picture was, ""Holmes, Lowell, and Longfellow Lie Buried in Mount Auburn""."
HPL	"However, he knew that he had actually become a somnambulist; for twice at night his room had been found vacant, though with all his clothing in place."
HPL	"""Fool,"" he shrieked, ""can you not guess my secret?"
HPL	"The other manuscript papers were all brief notes, some of them accounts of the queer dreams of different persons, some of them citations from theosophical books and magazines notably W. Scott Elliot's Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria, and the rest comments on long surviving secret societies and hidden cults, with references to passages in such mythological and anthropological source books as Frazer's Golden Bough and Miss Murray's Witch Cult in Western Europe."
HPL	"That night the wanderers left Ulthar, and were never seen again."
HPL	"Mr. Goldsmith, a little Man very vain of his Dress and very deficient in Brilliancy of Conversation, was my particular Favourite; since I was equally unable to shine in the Discourse."
HPL	"For as it was still echoing, I heard a creaking sound through the pitchy blackness, and knew that a lattice window was opening in that accursed old house beside us."
HPL	But I do not think my life will be long.
HPL	Lying on its side for it could not stand up alone was the exotic spiky figure which in his monstrous dream he had broken off the fantastic balustrade.
HPL	"There then followed an exhaustive comparison of details, and a moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart."
HPL	"Forbidding me to touch the body, he first injected a drug in the wrist just beside the place his needle had punctured when injecting the embalming compound."
HPL	"The newcomer was a thin, dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the Anglican church."
HPL	"The chamber, measuring about twenty feet square, contained like the other rooms some rubbish which had once been furniture."
HPL	"Some Kingsport fishermen heerd abaout the ketch an' come up in sloops, but they was all lost."
HPL	"He was more and more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door; but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of old time gold which still, as in his grandfather's time, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle buying."
HPL	"For I, and I only, know what manner of fear lurked on that spectral and desolate mountain."
HPL	"But he steadied me with that terrible, ice cold claw, and once more made his insidious gesture."
HPL	"Collins and First Mate Green, were killed; and the remaining eight under Second Mate Johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht, going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering back had existed."
HPL	"He would have descended and asked the way to Ooth Nargai had not a fearsome aurora sputtered up from some remote place beyond the horizon, shewing the ruin and antiquity of the city, and the stagnation of the reedy river, and the death lying upon that land, as it had lain since King Kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the vengeance of the gods."
HPL	I have said that I awaked suddenly and in alarm.
HPL	"When my hand touched his ear I shuddered, though I knew not why knew not why till I felt of the still face; the ice cold, stiffened, unbreathing face whose glassy eyes bulged uselessly into the void."
HPL	"It doesn't seem to me that earth can hold a dream like that It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy."
HPL	Nor could I ever after see the world as I had known it.
HPL	"More clicking, and after a pause a piteous cry from Warren: ""Beat it For God's sake, put back the slab and beat it, Carter"" Something in the boyish slang of my evidently stricken companion unleashed my faculties."
HPL	"So The Street slept uneasily on, till one night there gathered in Petrovitch's Bakery and the Rifkin School of Modern Economics, and the Circle Social Club, and Liberty Café, and in other places as well, vast hordes of men whose eyes were big with horrible triumph and expectation."
HPL	"He came back to Jermyn House a widower with an infant son, Alfred, who was one day to be the father of Arthur Jermyn."
HPL	His mania shewed itself only in his tight boarding up of all the windows in the reclaimed section though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all.
HPL	"His black hair was well cut and neatly brushed, and he was clean shaven though blue chinned with a heavy growth of beard."
HPL	Obed he kinder takes charge an' says things is goin' to be changed . . .
HPL	"Now that I had found them, my eagerness was again redoubled; for something in their arrangement dimly hinted that they might be only a few of many such, with dark, dumb counterparts wedged obscurely betwixt high blank walls and deserted rear tenements, or lurking lamplessly behind archways, unbetrayed by hordes of the foreign speaking or guarded by furtive and uncommunicative artists whose practices do not invite publicity or the light of day."
HPL	Heretofore a recluse so far as I know his true name and origin never having passed his lips my friend now became frantic in his fear of solitude.
HPL	"Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously."
HPL	"Dr. Muñoz I had never heard, save for certain sounds as of some gasoline driven mechanism; since his step was soft and gentle."
HPL	The effect was titanic altogether unthinkable and I might have stared indefinitely had not the sound of the piping seemed to grow stronger at my left.
HPL	"Then the doctor came with his medicine case and asked crisp questions, and removed the patient's outer clothing, shoes, and socks."
HPL	Neither age nor submersion has corroded the pristine grandeur of this awful fane for fane indeed it must be and today after thousands of years it rests untarnished and inviolate in the endless night and silence of an ocean chasm.
HPL	"Even had its outlines been unfamiliar we would have desired it, but as we looked more closely we saw that it was not wholly unfamiliar."
HPL	"Some of the Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and Miskatonic, though those sons seldom return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors were born."
HPL	The next day I ascended to the conning tower and commenced the customary searchlight explorations.
HPL	"Those who had lacked something lacked it no longer, yet did fear and hatred and ignorance still brood over The Street; for many had stayed behind, and many strangers had come from distant places to the ancient houses."
HPL	"It was not that the sounds were hideous, for they were not; but that they held vibrations suggesting nothing on this globe of earth, and that at certain intervals they assumed a symphonic quality which I could hardly conceive as produced by one player."
HPL	"Some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip, and I found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes."
HPL	"The town and country folk scarcely dared speak aloud, and the men of Libo's entourage, who had been there nearly a week, seemed to have caught something of the nameless dread."
HPL	At these times he would shew a sardonic humour and make remarks which the folk of Sheehan's deemed foolish and irrational.
HPL	"The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own."
HPL	"As he climbed slowly east, higher and higher above the estuary on his left and nearer and nearer the sea, he found the way growing in difficulty; till he wondered how ever the dwellers in that disliked place managed to reach the world outside, and whether they came often to market in Arkham."
HPL	"They filed a ponderous report at the court house in Aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper Miskatonic valley."
HPL	"The villagers of Hatheg say it is ill to climb Hatheg Kla at any time, and deadly to climb it by night when pale vapours hide the summit and the moon; but Barzai heeded them not when he came from neighbouring Ulthar with the young priest Atal, who was his disciple."
HPL	"All this Johansen did not suspect, but God knows he soon saw enough I suppose that only a single mountain top, the hideous monolith crowned citadel whereon great Cthulhu was buried, actually emerged from the waters."
HPL	"""I believe there's a chance of putting it out of business."
HPL	"All these things, however, the Elder Ones only may decide; and meanwhile the morning mist still comes up by that lonely vertiginous peak with the steep ancient house, that grey low eaved house where none is seen but where evening brings furtive lights while the north wind tells of strange revels."
HPL	"Why should he seek to avenge the death of poor Michel Mauvais, and how had the curse been carried on through all the long centuries since the time of Charles Le Sorcier?"
HPL	I myself would have thought of biological degeneration rather than alienage.
HPL	"He was rather a ""find"" a rich and high spirited youth who would ""go the limit"" in anything he undertook at least, that was the verdict of Pete Schultz, Sheehan's ""runner"", who had come across the boy at Lawrence College, in the small town of Appleton, Wisconsin."
HPL	"I climbed gentle hills from whose summits I could see entrancing panoramas of loveliness, with steepled towns nestling in verdant valleys, and with the golden domes of gigantic cities glittering on the infinitely distant horizon."
HPL	"First of all, the new light revealed the distorted and blackened form of the mysterious stranger."
HPL	"Detailed description would be rather unpleasant, but two salient particulars must be told, for they fit in revoltingly with certain notes of Sir Wade Jermyn's African expeditions and with the Congolese legends of the white god and the ape princess."
HPL	In a short time I realised that I must tell my story to someone or break down completely.
HPL	"He was alone in the sky with this queer and very disturbing house; and when he sidled around to the front and saw that the wall stood flush with the cliff's edge, so that the single narrow door was not to be reached save from the empty aether, he felt a distinct terror that altitude could not wholly explain."
HPL	Then he saw the old woman and the small furry thing advancing toward him over the carpeted floor.
HPL	"In time there were no more swords, three cornered hats, or periwigs in The Street."
HPL	It would be a city greater than Innsmouth next time.
HPL	"By this time Dombrowski, Choynski, Desrochers, Mazurewicz, and the top floor lodger were all crowding into the doorway, and the landlord had sent his wife back to telephone for Dr. Malkowski."
HPL	"I did it for so long that life faded to a far memory, and I became one with the moles and grubs of nighted depths."
HPL	"Great holes secretly are digged where earth's pores ought to suffice, and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl."""
HPL	"Furtive, shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction, and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously."
HPL	"And as I watched the ripples that told of the writhing of worms beneath, I felt a new chill from afar out whither the condor had flown, as if my flesh had caught a horror before my eyes had seen it."
HPL	Only the din of street cars in the thoroughfare below proved a serious annoyance.
HPL	"Immediately afterward Jermyn emerged from the room, rushing frantically toward the front of the house as if pursued by some hideous enemy."
HPL	"Once he had the landlord nail tin over it, but the next night the rats gnawed a fresh hole in making which they pushed or dragged out into the room a curious little fragment of bone."
HPL	"If it came from within the house, we had the window ladders; if from outside, the door and the stairs."
HPL	"Tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the revolver which I had almost unconsciously drawn, but from his expression I was sure he had seen and heard as much as I, if not a great deal more."
HPL	Too well did I recall the squat church from which those notes came.
HPL	"Of polished desert quarried marble were its walls, in height cubits and in breadth , so that chariots might pass each other as men drave them along the top."
HPL	"Klenze seemed paralysed and inefficient, as one might expect of a soft, womanish Rhinelander."
HPL	"No? Wal, Mis' Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o' the glen, an' ain't got to your haouse yet, I calc'late they must go into the glen itself."
HPL	"He got in communication with Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended Old Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the grandfather's last words as quoted by the physician."
HPL	"It was the Yuletide, and I had come at last to the ancient sea town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when festival was forbidden; where also they had commanded their sons to keep festival once every century, that the memory of primal secrets might not be forgotten."
HPL	"West of that were the fine old residence streets Broad, Washington, Lafayette, and Adams and east of it were the shoreward slums."
HPL	"The place was avoided with doubled assiduousness, and invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply."
HPL	"Nobody cud git aout o' them whar they got all the stuff, an' all the other natives wondered haow they managed to find fish in plenty even when the very next islands had lean pickin's."
HPL	"This is what I saw in the glass: A thin, dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the Anglican church, apparently about thirty, and with rimless, steel bowed glasses glistening beneath a sallow, olive forehead of abnormal height."
HPL	"I also rose, and both stood motionless for a time, straining our ears as the uncanny rhythm seemed more and more to take on a vital quality."
HPL	"There was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought to rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud."
HPL	"That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings."
HPL	"The moans of the sick men were decidedly annoying; but since they did not appear to demoralise the rest of the crew, we did not resort to extreme measures."
HPL	My other pursuers had been accursedly abnormal so should I not have been ready to face a strengthening of the abnormal element; to look upon forms in which there was no mixture of the normal at all?
HPL	"On the contrary, my admiration for him kept growing; for that ""Ghoul Feeding"" was a tremendous achievement."
HPL	"They were not altogether crows, nor moles, nor buzzards, nor ants, nor vampire bats, nor decomposed human beings; but something I cannot and must not recall."

HPL	"They had chained him down to things that are, and had then explained the workings of those things till mystery had gone out of the world."
HPL	"Later, I told myself, I should grow to a strength and ingenuity which might enable me to unfasten the heavily chained door with ease; but until then I would do better by conforming to what seemed the will of Fate."
HPL	"""Walakea he shewed Obed a lot o' rites an' incantations as had to do with the sea things, an' let him see some o' the folks in the village as had changed a lot from human shape."
HPL	"Strange urges still tugged at him, but he could sidetrack them with considerable success."
HPL	"Zann's screaming viol now outdid itself, emitting sounds I had never thought a viol could emit."
HPL	"There was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and a sound that the chronicler would not put on paper."
HPL	"Near the central desk a revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been fired."
HPL	"Most of this information reached the outside world through young Jan Martense, who from some kind of restlessness joined the colonial army when news of the Albany Convention reached Tempest Mountain."
HPL	"The sum of all my investigation was, that in a kind of semi uncorporeal dream life Slater wandered or floated through resplendent and prodigious valleys, meadows, gardens, cities, and palaces of light; in a region unbounded and unknown to man."
HPL	"Plainly, this house was of the old world."
HPL	"The gorilla was off its guard, but not for long, and before anything could be done by the regular trainer the body which had belonged to a baronet was past recognition."
HPL	"Amidst this elysian realm I dwelt not as a stranger, for each sight and sound was familiar to me; just as it had been for uncounted aeons of eternity before, and would be for like eternities to come."
HPL	What I heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that people died there in alarmingly great numbers.
HPL	"Of any land upheaval in the Pacific, my rescuers knew nothing; nor did I deem it necessary to insist upon a thing which I knew they could not believe."

HPL	"Where once had risen walls of cubits and towers yet higher, now stretched only the marshy shore, and where once had dwelt fifty millions of men now crawled only the detestable green water lizard."
HPL	"Professor Angell must have employed a cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous and the sources scattered throughout the globe."

HPL	"Here, truly, was the apotheosis of the unnamable."
HPL	"This the young warriors took back with them to Sarnath as a symbol of conquest over the old gods and beings of Ib, and a sign of leadership in Mnar."
HPL	"Through these pipes came at will the odours our moods most craved; sometimes the scent of pale funeral lilies, sometimes the narcotic incense of imagined Eastern shrines of the kingly dead, and sometimes how I shudder to recall it the frightful, soul upheaving stenches of the uncovered grave."
HPL	"Warmer every minute, and the tissues can't last."
HPL	"The dirty looking fellow who waited on me had a touch of the staring ""Innsmouth look"", but was quite civil in his way; being perhaps used to the custom of such convivial strangers truckmen, gold buyers, and the like as were occasionally in town."
HPL	Is it not possible that the germ of an actual contagious madness lurks in the depths of that shadow over Innsmouth?
HPL	"He lived with one manservant in a Georgian homestead with knocker and iron railed steps, balanced eerily on a steep ascent of North Court Street beside the ancient brick court and colony house where his grandfather a cousin of that celebrated privateersman, Capt."

HPL	"Confused memories mixed themselves with his mathematics, and he believed his subconscious mind held the angles which he needed to guide him back to the normal world alone and unaided for the first time."
HPL	"No more could his galleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of Thran, or his elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kled, where forgotten palaces with veined ivory columns sleep lovely and unbroken under the moon."
HPL	Shortly afterward the pale faced workmen apprised the Superintendent of their failure.
HPL	"""Those Whateleys meant to let them in, and the worst of all is left Tell Rice and Morgan we must do something it's a blind business, but I know how to make the powder. . . ."
HPL	"They were the dissimilar Martense eyes of the old legends, and I knew in one inundating cataclysm of voiceless horror what had become of that vanished family; the terrible and thunder crazed house of Martense."
HPL	What would the storm call forth or was there anything left for it to call?

HPL	"It was in those college days that he had begun his terrible experiments, first on small animals and then on human bodies shockingly obtained."
HPL	"They were Donovan, Guerrera, and Ångstrom."
HPL	"Barzai the Wise they never found, nor could the holy priest Atal ever be persuaded to pray for his soul's repose."
HPL	The night shift did not go on that evening.
HPL	"Things went on that way fer years, an' Obed got enough o' that gold like stuff to make him start the refinery in Waite's old run daown fullin' mill."
HPL	"Besides, the grocery youth had told me that the churches, as well as the Order of Dagon Hall, were not advisable neighbourhoods for strangers."
HPL	"Finally the air grew thin, and the sky changed colour, and the climbers found it hard to breathe; but still they toiled up and up, marvelling at the strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the thought of what would happen on the summit when the moon was out and the pale vapours spread around."
HPL	"He looked at the mists from the diadem of Father Neptune, and tried to walk into their white world of mystery along the titan steps of The Causeway."
HPL	"I felt immediately that it was the right one; a guess which the half illegible sign on the windshield ""Arkham Innsmouth Newb'port"" soon verified."
HPL	"generally stopped at the Mansion House in Benefit Street the renamed Golden Ball Inn whose roof has sheltered Washington, Jefferson, and Lafayette and his favourite walk led northward along the same street to Mrs. Whitman's home and the neighbouring hillside churchyard of St. John's, whose hidden expanse of eighteenth century gravestones had for him a peculiar fascination."
HPL	"The floor of the forest was mossy and mysterious, and great lichened rocks rose vaguely here and there in the dim light like Druid monoliths among the swollen and twisted trunks of a sacred grove."
HPL	"He even says that all the village knew of my journeys to the tomb, and that I was often watched as I slept in the bower outside the grim facade, my half open eyes fixed on the crevice that leads to the interior."
HPL	"I began to feel that the tomb was mine, and to look forward with hot eagerness to the time when I might pass within that stone door and down those slimy stone steps in the dark."
HPL	They were that kind the old lattice windows that went out of use before .
HPL	"I told him, he shou'd not try to pasquinade the Source of his sy."
HPL	"Certainly it sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments of French often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that language, or that the same person, alone and guarded, complained wildly of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her."
HPL	"A Sicilian owns it, and I've hired it under the name of Peters."
HPL	"In the brooding fire of autumn Carter took the old remembered way past graceful lines of rolling hill and stone walled meadow, distant vale and hanging woodland, curving road and nestling farmstead, and the crystal windings of the Miskatonic, crossed here and there by rustic bridges of wood or stone."
HPL	"""Everybody was in a bad way them days."
HPL	It had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle's research.
HPL	"Yes he was really forming words, and I could grasp a fair proportion of them."
HPL	"The manuscript was divided into two sections, the first of which was headed "" Dream and Dream Work of H. A. Wilcox, Thomas St., Providence, R.I."", and the second, ""Narrative of Inspector John R. Legrasse, Bienville St., New Orleans, La., at A. A. S. Mtg."
HPL	"Mazurewicz seemed half dazed because of a ""sign"" he said he had had in response to his prayers, and he crossed himself frantically when the squealing and whimpering of a rat sounded from beyond the slanting partition."
HPL	"Several times he had actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead; in many cases violent signs; but he soon saw that the perfection of this process, if indeed possible, would necessarily involve a lifetime of research."
HPL	"The insane yarn I had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams, and I felt I must keep the image of his wild, watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination."
HPL	"""Yes, there's a hotel in Innsmouth called the Gilman House but I don't believe it can amount to much."
HPL	"Haow'd ye like to be livin' in a taown like this, with everything a rottin' an' a dyin', an' boarded up monsters crawlin' an' bleatin' an' barkin' an' hoppin' araoun' black cellars an' attics every way ye turn?"
HPL	But for one thing Old Bugs would have been an ideal slave to the establishment and that one thing was his conduct when young men were introduced for their first drink.
HPL	"What the police did extract, came mainly from an immensely aged mestizo named Castro, who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult in the mountains of China."
HPL	"He had been flushed and excited then, talking in a high and unnatural, though always pedantic, voice."
HPL	"In Babson Street, which crossed Federal and might thus reveal me to the searchers, I clung as closely as possible to the sagging, uneven buildings; twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased."
HPL	"I wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this man might be, and whether his obstinate refusal of outside aid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity."
HPL	"They all lay in stone houses in Their great city of R'lyeh, preserved by the spells of mighty Cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for Them."
HPL	There was thunder in the air on the night I went to the deserted mansion atop Tempest Mountain to find the lurking fear.
HPL	"Always an ice cold intellectual machine; slight, blond, blue eyed, and spectacled; I think he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine neutrality."
HPL	"Something in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence, and for a long hour he led me forward without needless words; making only the briefest of comments concerning ancient names and dates and changes, and directing my progress very largely by gestures as we squeezed through interstices, tiptoed through corridors, clambered over brick walls, and once crawled on hands and knees through a low, arched passage of stone whose immense length and tortuous twistings effaced at last every hint of geographical location I had managed to preserve."
HPL	"In the spring after Wilbur's birth Lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child."
HPL	"On this occasion he crawled in as usual, lighting his way with matches filched from the sitting room match safe, and edging through the final crevice with an eagerness hard to explain even to himself."
HPL	"Then I would loaf near the fire station in apparent casualness, and fall in with old Zadok after he had started on one of his frequent rambles."
HPL	"He found the man, Athib, sitting on the same chest of spices he had sat upon before, and Athib seemed not to realise that any time had passed."
HPL	The stormy vigil reminded me shudderingly of my ghastly night on Tempest Mountain.
HPL	"Its designs, however, were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild, they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing."
HPL	"That storm, said men who had ventured down the mine shaft, had caused extensive caving in, and had completely closed the deep abyss which had created so much apprehension the day before."
HPL	"He was a strange, furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder as if afraid of something, and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers."
HPL	"The appearance of this man, and the instinctive fear he inspired, prepared me for something like enmity; so that I almost shuddered through surprise and a sense of uncanny incongruity when he motioned me to a chair and addressed me in a thin, weak voice full of fawning respect and ingratiating hospitality."
HPL	"Or rather, there's only one living soul for I haven't been digging around in the past for nothing ""See here, you're interested in this sort of thing."
HPL	"Altogether, Old Bugs was not pleasing to look upon."
HPL	"The moon, now near the zenith, shone weirdly and vividly above the towering steeps that hemmed in the chasm, and revealed the fact that a far flung body of water flowed at the bottom, winding out of sight in both directions, and almost lapping my feet as I stood on the slope."
HPL	"""Ebenezer cud read a leetle o' this 'tis Latin but I can't."
HPL	"And where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished; for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare."
HPL	"He seemed to know what was coming the monstrous burst of Walpurgis rhythm in whose cosmic timbre would be concentrated all the primal, ultimate space time seethings which lie behind the massed spheres of matter and sometimes break forth in measured reverberations that penetrate faintly to every layer of entity and give hideous significance throughout the worlds to certain dreaded periods."
HPL	"Mixed with the present scene was always a little of the past and a little of the future, and every once familiar object loomed alien in the new perspective brought by my widened sight."
HPL	It was that of a man clad in a skull cap and long mediaeval tunic of dark colour.
HPL	"The great stone city R'lyeh, with its monoliths and sepulchres, had sunk beneath the waves; and the deep waters, full of the one primal mystery through which not even thought can pass, had cut off the spectral intercourse."
HPL	"Without his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was scarcely visible before, and I wondered if this unperceived mark of singular longevity were not one of the sources of my original disquiet."
HPL	"There were shelves full of theological and classical books, and another bookcase containing treatises on magic Paracelsus, Albertus Magnus, Trithemius, Hermes Trismegistus, Borellus, and others in strange alphabets whose titles I could not decipher."
HPL	"When he entered the city, past the bronze gates and over the onyx pavements, the merchants and camel drivers greeted him as if he had never been away; and it was the same at the turquoise temple of Nath Horthath, where the orchid wreathed priests told him that there is no time in Ooth Nargai, but only perpetual youth."
HPL	"I had heard no speech so far in this quarter, and was unaccountably anxious not to do so."
HPL	"They call them gold like things pirate loot, an' allaow the Innsmouth folks hez furren blood or is distempered or somethin'."
HPL	"Before evening I was in the village, getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes."
HPL	Yet nothing whatever happened to Gilman till about the time of the fever.
HPL	That peddler told the store loungers at Dunwich Village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above.
HPL	Very plausibly his saner self argued that the place must be tenanted by people who reached it from inland along the easier ridge beside the Miskatonic's estuary.
HPL	"The sight seemed to displease him, for he began a series of weak curses which ended in a confidential whisper and a knowing leer."
HPL	Ef they dun't they'll kinder quiet daown like.
HPL	Animal fury and orgiastic licence here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstasies that tore and reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell.
HPL	"All to onct Sally she yelled agin, an' says the front yard picket fence hed just crumbled up, though they wa'n't no sign o' what done it."
HPL	What I did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb old man.
HPL	"One window had lost its entire frame, and in the other there was not a trace of glass in the little diamond apertures."
HPL	You say to me that there is nothing in the swamp or near it which could form the setting of that frightful episode.
HPL	"""Good old rye, an' as fiery as ya kin find anyw'eres in Chi'."""
HPL	"So through endless twilights I dreamed and waited, though I knew not what I waited for."
HPL	As I crawled into the stranded boat I realised that only one theory could explain my position.
HPL	"Filled with wonder, yet now realising how the man had obtained access to the chateau, I proceeded to return."
HPL	"Then I tried the opposite of the soothing plan, and told him he was mad pitifully demented."
HPL	"And the bearded man made enigmatical gestures of prayer, and lit tall candles in curiously wrought brass candlesticks."
HPL	"The screaming twilight abysses flashed before him, and he felt himself helpless in the formless grasp of the iridescent bubble congeries."
HPL	"My knowledge of the thing began in the winter of with the death of my grand uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island."
HPL	"His feet were indistinguishable because of the table and bench, but he must have been shod, since there was a clicking whenever he changed position."
HPL	"The complaining ædile's own mother Helvia was a pure Roman, the daughter of M. Helvius Cinna, who had come over with Scipio's army."
HPL	"Also, Dombrowski must attend to the poisoning of those rats in the walls."
HPL	"I said to myself, ""This is no dream, for by what means can I prove the greater reality of that other life in the house of stone and brick south of the sinister swamp and the cemetery on the low hillock, where the Pole Star peers into my north window each night?"""
HPL	"You know what a fiend he was for revenge how he ruined old Raymond thirty years after their boundary suit, and how he stepped on the puppy that snapped at him a year ago last August. . . ."
HPL	"The street lights we first encountered had been of oil, and of the ancient lozenge pattern."
HPL	"Major Sir Eric Moreland Clapham Lee, D.S.O., was the greatest surgeon in our division, and had been hastily assigned to the St. Eloi sector when news of the heavy fighting reached headquarters."
HPL	"Just what Crawford Tillinghast now wished of me I could only guess, but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to impart, I could not doubt."
HPL	"Once most of the young men went away, and some never came back."
HPL	"Distant though the island was, he felt that a monstrous and invincible evil could flow from the sardonic stare of that bent, ancient figure in brown."
HPL	"A sense of monstrous guilt was upon the land, and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places."
HPL	"Some of the neighbouring families who had heard tales of old Sir Wade Jermyn's unseen Portuguese wife declared that her Latin blood must be shewing itself; but most persons merely sneered at his sensitiveness to beauty, attributing it to his music hall mother, who was socially unrecognised."
HPL	"On reflection, he was glad he had not consulted the still more inquisitive college doctor."
HPL	"In the Reverend Abijah Hoadley, newly come to the Congregational Church at Dunwich Village, preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of Satan and his imps; in which he said: ""It must be allow'd, that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of Daemons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny'd; the cursed Voices of Azazel and Buzrael, of Beelzebub and Belial, being heard now from under Ground by above a Score of credible Witnesses now living."
HPL	"The abysses were by no means vacant, being crowded with indescribably angled masses of alien hued substance, some of which appeared to be organic while others seemed inorganic."
HPL	"Simultaneously there developed something like a cold draught, which apparently swept past me from the direction of the distant sound."
HPL	"And I was too dazed to exult when he whispered back a thing I had half expected ""No it wasn't that way at all."
HPL	"One evening as I strolled on Victoria Embankment for some needed air, I saw a black shape obscure one of the reflections of the lamps in the water."
HPL	"In broad daylight, and at most seasons I am apt to think the greater part of it a mere dream; but sometimes in the autumn, about two in the morning when winds and animals howl dismally, there comes from inconceivable depths below a damnable suggestion of rhythmical throbbing . . ."
HPL	"Our men searched him for souvenirs, and found in his coat pocket a very odd bit of ivory carved to represent a youth's head crowned with laurel."
HPL	All through the long hellish hours of blackness it shines there.
HPL	"The harbour, long clogged with sand, was enclosed by an ancient stone breakwater; on which I could begin to discern the minute forms of a few seated fishermen, and at whose end were what looked like the foundations of a bygone lighthouse."
HPL	"I cannot reckon the number of hours I spent in gazing at the sunken city with its buildings, arches, statues, and bridges, and the colossal temple with its beauty and mystery."
HPL	Do you wonder how it will seem?
HPL	"And it was wrought of one piece of ivory, though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece could have come."
HPL	"The expression on her face was one of hideous malevolence and exultation, and when he awaked he could recall a croaking voice that persuaded and threatened."
HPL	"My father, his face lined with sorrow, stood by as I shouted my demands to be laid within the tomb; frequently admonishing my captors to treat me as gently as they could."
HPL	"Some believe this crucifix was dragged up to the sealed loft by rats, while others think it must have been on the floor in some corner of Gilman's old room all the time."
HPL	There were also some curious muddy rat tracks leading out of a fresh hole and back into it again.
HPL	"After a full two hours Dr. Davis left, urging Birch to insist at all times that his wounds were caused entirely by loose nails and splintering wood."
HPL	"Queer haow a cravin' gits a holt on ye As ye love the Almighty, young man, don't tell nobody, but I swar ter Gawd thet picter begun ta make me hungry fer victuals I couldn't raise nor buy here, set still, what's ailin' ye?"
HPL	"He indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings, and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees but I suppose he had been hearing too much native superstition."
HPL	I allus says Col' Spring Glen ain't no healthy nor decent place.
HPL	"That evening, just as twilight fell, he finished his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted."
HPL	"The ridged, barrel shaped centre, the thin, radiating arms, the knobs at each end, and the flat, slightly outward curving starfish arms spreading from those knobs all were there."
HPL	"And as I writhe in my guilty agony, frantic to save the city whose peril every moment grows, and vainly striving to shake off this unnatural dream of a house of stone and brick south of a sinister swamp and a cemetery on a low hillock; the Pole Star, evil and monstrous, leers down from the black vault, winking hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some strange message, yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey."
HPL	"He was good for nothing that morning, and stayed away from all his classes."
HPL	"Its condition was almost perfect, and one could have spent hours in studying the striking and puzzlingly untraditional designs some simply geometrical, and some plainly marine chased or moulded in high relief on its surface with a craftsmanship of incredible skill and grace."
HPL	"On a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally strong, and when, in addition, I had fancied I glimpsed a kind of thin, yellowish, shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward the yawning fireplace, I spoke to my uncle about the matter."
HPL	"""Heh, heh, heh, heh Beginnin' to see, hey?"
HPL	"For the squat creatures were mighty in the arts of war, and knew not the scruples of honour which held back our tall, grey eyed men of Lomar from ruthless conquest."
HPL	"Not for a moment did I believe that the tale had any really substantial foundation; but none the less the account held a hint of genuine terror, if only because it brought in references to strange jewels clearly akin to the malign tiara I had seen at Newburyport."
HPL	And finally he had spoken of the living things in such a manner that he was taken to the madhouse.
HPL	Utter bewilderment and the fear of madness racked Gilman as he staggered to the door and saw that there were no muddy prints outside.
HPL	"Upon landing in Salem Zerubbabel set it up in his cupboard beside the chimney, he having built a modest house near the town pump."
HPL	"Dr. Job Ives diagnosed the trouble as some infantile fever, though others declared it was more of a mere wasting away or decline."
HPL	"I'm middle aged and decently sophisticated, and I guess you saw enough of me in France to know I'm not easily knocked out."
HPL	"The old man was getting hysterical, and I began to shiver with a nameless alarm."
HPL	"The old captains of the sea came often to my grandfather and told him of these things, which in turn he told to my father, and my father told to me in the long autumn evenings when the wind howled eerily from the East."
HPL	"When Carter left, he had said he was going to visit his old ancestral country around Arkham."
HPL	"Not but what I think it's the Lord's jedgment fer our iniquities, that no mortal kin ever set aside."" Armitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke decisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics."

HPL	"In the spring of Jonathan Gifford, the Albany friend of Jan Martense, became worried by his correspondent's silence; especially in view of the conditions and quarrels at the Martense mansion."
HPL	"He licked the nose of the bottle and slipped it into his pocket, then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself."
HPL	"There it stood; deserted, feared, and linked with the vengeful ghost of Jan Martense."
HPL	"As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and about the monstrous being known to the human world as Wilbur Whateley."
HPL	"Friends said that it was this series of griefs which unhinged the mind of Sir Robert Jermyn, yet it was probably merely a bit of African folklore which caused the disaster."
HPL	"Them as was born more like the things changed arly, but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy, though they'd usually go daown under fer trial trips afore that."
HPL	Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering created.
HPL	"I must have fallen asleep from fatigue, for it was with a distinct sense of awakening that I heard the voices."
HPL	"He had not noticed the time on the Kingsport steeple, though he could easily have made it out with his pocket telescope; but he knew his lateness was something very strange and unprecedented."
HPL	"But though Iranon was sad he ceased not to sing, and at evening told again his dreams of Aira, the city of marble and beryl."
HPL	"I said to myself, with all the ardour of a sculptor, that this man was a faun's statue out of antique Hellas, dug from a temple's ruins and brought somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of devastating years."
HPL	"After a moment of gazing Morgan cried out sharply, passing the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the slope with his finger."
HPL	Something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his imagination.
HPL	"Whenever the morgue proved inadequate, two local negroes attended to this matter, and they were seldom questioned."

HPL	"As I slowly traversed the nitre encrusted passageway at the foot of the last staircase, the paving became very damp, and soon I saw by the light of my flickering torch that a blank, water stained wall impeded my journey."
HPL	On the morning of the th Gilman awaked into a maelstrom of horror.
HPL	"Tired and perspiring despite many rests, he descended to the floor and sat a while on the bottom box to gather strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside."
HPL	"He had heard, meanwhile, of Whateley's grotesque trip to Cambridge, and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener Library."
HPL	"I called the peak a bit of outcropping rock, but Klenze thought he saw carvings on it."
HPL	"Besides, what was found might possibly have more than one explanation."
HPL	"Very suddenly Barzai went out of Atal's sight, scaling a hideous cliff that seemed to bulge outward and block the path for any climber not inspired of earth's gods."
HPL	A larger man guided his steps; a repellent hulk whose bluish face seemed half eaten away by some unknown malady.
HPL	"Some frightful influence, I felt, was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnamable abysses of blackness and alienage; and the process told heavily on me."
HPL	Something had evidently drawn a crowd to this place.
HPL	"On every hand were the signs of neglect and decrepitude, and I seemed haunted by the notion that Warren and I were the first living creatures to invade a lethal silence of centuries."
HPL	"Of the six men who never reached the ship, he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant."
HPL	"Once more in shadow, I resumed my former dog trot past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night."
HPL	"I found difficulty in moving toward the stair well, but when I did get there I found no crushed body on the floor below."
HPL	"In a squalid thieves' den an entire family had been torn to shreds by an unknown thing which left no trace, and those around had heard all night above the usual clamour of drunken voices a faint, deep, insistent note as of a gigantic hound."
HPL	"It struck me as horribly like a sort of Oriental ceremony, with beating of drums and chanting of many voices."
HPL	"Then he began to ascend the stairs, and joined me in the attic."
HPL	"At length I reached the lower hall, at one end of which I saw a faint luminous rectangle marking the ruined Paine Street doorway."
HPL	"But half buried in the rushes was spied a curious green idol of stone; an exceedingly ancient idol coated with seaweed and chiselled in the likeness of Bokrug, the great water lizard."
HPL	"My uncle's face came to me with less pleasant associations than in waking hours, and I recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream."
HPL	"But it was lonely among strangers, so Barry had asked me to come."
HPL	all made o' squirmin' ropes . . .
HPL	"The air had begun to be exceedingly unwholesome; but to this detail he paid no attention as he toiled, half by feeling, at the heavy and corroded metal of the latch."
HPL	"As I hung back, the old man produced his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy of my fathers who had founded the Yule worship in this ancient place; that it had been decreed I should come back, and that the most secret mysteries were yet to be performed."
HPL	"It was indeed somewhat familiar, for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted curtain of a theatre."
HPL	Mathematics folklore the house old Keziah Brown Jenkin . . .
HPL	"These I had tested with a fellow student; but achieving no result, had soon packed them away with other scientific odds and ends for possible future use."
HPL	"In the midst of this debris, wedged between a fallen plank and a cluster of cemented bricks from the ruined chimney, was an object destined to cause more bafflement, veiled fright, and openly superstitious talk in Arkham than anything else discovered in the haunted and accursed building."
HPL	"He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears."
HPL	"Eventually Jermyn asked and obtained permission to train the animal, astonishing audiences and fellow performers alike with his success."
HPL	"Innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable, and I turned down Paine Street toward the Square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to Arkham before the still distant starting time of that sinister bus."
HPL	"This view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the Marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence, and which they repeated to this day despite the Society's unvarying determination not to sell."
HPL	"It is true that I have for five years been his closest friend, and a partial sharer of his terrible researches into the unknown."
HPL	"""Wal, as I says, the natives met the things on the little volcanic islet goin' thar in canoes with the sacrifices et cet'ry, and bringin' back any of the gold like jools as was comin' to 'em."
HPL	"Awed, shaken, and portentous, my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never venture within those realms again."
HPL	"One night I espied upon the deck a man, bearded and robed, and he seemed to beckon me to embark for fair unknown shores."
HPL	At this juncture my brain became aware of a steady external influence operating upon it.
HPL	"Evidently he found the society of a well born man a rare novelty in this dingy environment, and was moved to unaccustomed speech as memories of better days surged over him."
HPL	"After that experience West had dropped his researches for some time; but as the zeal of the born scientist slowly returned, he again became importunate with the college faculty, pleading for the use of the dissecting room and of fresh human specimens for the work he regarded as so overwhelmingly important."
HPL	"Over the cities once more floated the Old Flag, companioned by the New Flag and by a plainer yet glorious Tri colour."
HPL	"""Ave, Caesar, moriturus te saluto"" he shouted, and dropped to the whiskey reeking floor, never to rise again."
HPL	"That we could not understand, for we had patted down the mould very carefully."
HPL	"There are horrors beyond horrors, and this was one of those nuclei of all dreamable hideousness which the cosmos saves to blast an accursed and unhappy few."
HPL	"""Killin' sheep was kinder more fun but d'ye know, 'twan't quite satisfyin'."
HPL	"Don't know, eh? You'll know soon enough Look at me listen to what I say do you suppose there are really any such things as time and magnitude?"
HPL	He had indeed come back to the Valley of Ooth Nargai and the splendid city of Celephaïs.
HPL	"For some reason thought is very horrible to him, and anything which stirs the imagination he flees as a plague."
HPL	Only after two years did I connect this fear with anything in particular; but then I began to see that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault whose position at different times corresponded to the direction of his glance a spot roughly marked by the constellation Corona Borealis.
HPL	"Old Castro, unfortunately, had been dead for some years."
HPL	"Nevertheless the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock, and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow."
HPL	"I was very glad of this partial shelter, since at this point the Rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view."
HPL	"I'm going to burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you'll dynamite that altar stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills."
HPL	"Whilst they strove to strip from life its embroidered robes of myth, and to shew in naked ugliness the foul thing that is reality, Kuranes sought for beauty alone."
HPL	"Williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather; though for Orne material I had to depend on my uncle Walter, who put at my disposal the contents of all his files, including notes, letters, cuttings, heirlooms, photographs, and miniatures."
HPL	"Some fear had been gathering in me, perhaps because of the strangeness of my heritage, and the bleakness of the evening, and the queerness of the silence in that aged town of curious customs."
HPL	"On Wednesday, June , , after a proper notification of Carrington Harris which did not include surmises as to what we expected to find, my uncle and I conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a folding camp cot, together with some scientific mechanism of greater weight and intricacy."
HPL	"ye swilled yourselves sick, curse ye, and ye must needs blame the squire let go, you Unhand that latch I've naught for ye here "" At this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the panels of the door, and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic magician."
HPL	"Examining the great tree where it had lurked, I could discern no distinctive marks."
HPL	"Burials without embalming were made in rapid succession, and even the Christchurch Cemetery receiving tomb was crammed with coffins of the unembalmed dead."
HPL	The yellowed county records containing her testimony and that of her accusers were so damnably suggestive of things beyond human experience and the descriptions of the darting little furry object which served as her familiar were so painfully realistic despite their incredible details.
HPL	"Nor could he talk of these matters at all save with the Terrible Old Man, who afterward mumbled queer things in his long white beard; vowing that the man who came down from that crag was not wholly the man who went up, and that somewhere under that grey peaked roof, or amidst inconceivable reaches of that sinister white mist, there lingered still the lost spirit of him who was Thomas Olney."
HPL	The crowning horror came that very night.
HPL	"My host appeared not to notice this, and in courtesy I kept silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway, across a hall, and into a room whose door I heard him lock behind us."
HPL	"There ran little streams over bright pebbles, dividing meads of green and gardens of many hues, and spanned by a multitude of bridges."
HPL	Apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent.
HPL	"At first I beheld nothing but a seething blur of luminosity; but then shapes, all infinitely distant, began to detach themselves from the confusion, and I saw was it Juan Romero?"
