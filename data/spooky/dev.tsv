HPL	"I studied the loose, antique masonry of the walls in the fungus light and the feeble rays which stole in from the street through the screened windows; and once, when the noisome atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me, I opened the door and looked up and down the street, feasting my eyes on familiar sights and my nostrils on the wholesome air."
HPL	"Each of these knobs was the hub of a system of five long, flat, triangularly tapering arms arranged around it like the arms of a starfish nearly horizontal, but curving slightly away from the central barrel."
HPL	"There was, however, something he wanted in embattled Flanders; and in order to secure it he had to assume a military exterior."
HPL	"""You thought ultra violet was invisible, and so it is but you can see that and many other invisible things now."
HPL	Always the same the night before the Kalends of Maius and the night before the Kalends of November.
HPL	"Many months passed, yet in the sour face of Musides came nothing of the sharp expectancy which the situation should arouse."
HPL	"Steps sounded again, and Olney edged round to the north; but before he could find a haven a voice called softly, and he knew he must confront his host."
HPL	"Houses went up of them, and more and at last one fateful night a titan thing occurred."
HPL	"The man who had been Joe Slater, the Catskill decadent, was now gazing at me with a pair of luminous, expanded eyes whose blue seemed subtly to have deepened."
HPL	"""I'll never get the picture out of my head as long as I live."
HPL	That upstairs looks it will have the right cast.
HPL	"My coming to New York had been a mistake; for whereas I had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration in the teeming labyrinths of ancient streets that twist endlessly from forgotten courts and squares and waterfronts to courts and squares and waterfronts equally forgotten, and in the Cyclopean modern towers and pinnacles that rise blackly Babylonian under waning moons, I had found instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to master, paralyse, and annihilate me."
HPL	"In the gardens of these cities are strange orchids, and perfumed lakes whose beds are of coral and amber."
HPL	"When I suggested other physicians, the sufferer would fly into as much of a rage as he seemed to dare to entertain."
HPL	I could not see from my side of the hotel the southward route toward Arkham which I had determined to take.
HPL	"Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in detail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length."
HPL	"And day by day that Romnod who had been a small boy in granite Teloth grew coarser and redder with wine, till he dreamed less and less, and listened with less delight to the songs of Iranon."
HPL	"Some of these were sealed and intact, but others had nearly vanished, leaving the silver handles and plates isolated amidst certain curious heaps of whitish dust."
HPL	What he wanted were bodies from which vitality had only just departed; bodies with every cell intact and capable of receiving again the impulse toward that mode of motion called life.
HPL	"My next step was to re examine with microscopic care the deserted hamlet where death had come most abundantly, and where Arthur Munroe had seen something he never lived to describe."
HPL	"Habitués say that it was at this point they noticed a cessation in the regular, monotonous strokes of the mop."
HPL	"I was almost paralysed, but not too much so to make a feeble effort toward flight; a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in which the nameless, voiceless monster held me."
HPL	"Then the old man made a signal to the half seen flute player in the darkness, which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce louder drone in another key; precipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable and unexpected."
HPL	"Another thing which puzzled and disturbed me, even in some of the best preserved mansions, was the tightly shuttered condition of many third story and attic windows."
HPL	"We never come here at night, and it's only because of his will that we keep it this way."
HPL	"It was about a foot square, and its Gothic carvings were so fearful that he did not marvel no person since Edmund Carter had dared to open it."
HPL	"Studying the grocery youth's map and seeking a route I had not traversed before, I chose Marsh Street instead of State for my approach to Town Square."
HPL	"That night Slater slept quietly, and the next morning he wakened with no singular feature save a certain alteration of expression."
HPL	In about two hours the boat rested in a paved plaza close to the rocky wall of the valley.
HPL	"In the small hours of that night he slept a little in an easy chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before dawn."
HPL	"I was pouring something from one test tube to another, and West was busy over the alcohol blast lamp which had to answer for a Bunsen burner in this gasless edifice, when from the pitch black room we had left there burst the most appalling and daemoniac succession of cries that either of us had ever heard."
HPL	"The roof of the void, as seen whilst it was open, was not by any means thick; yet now the drills of the investigators met what appeared to be a limitless extent of solid rock."
HPL	"Beyond that wall in the grey dawn he came to a land of quaint gardens and cherry trees, and when the sun rose he beheld such beauty of red and white flowers, green foliage and lawns, white paths, diamond brooks, blue lakelets, carven bridges, and red roofed pagodas, that he for a moment forgot Celephaïs in sheer delight."
HPL	"During a free period he shewed the queer image to several professors, all of whom were intensely interested, though none of them could shed any light upon its nature or origin."
HPL	By complying with his suicidal request I could immediately free myself from one who was no longer a companion but a menace.
HPL	He had seen a little deeper beneath Old Bugs' mask of utter degradation.
HPL	"His name was John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector of Police."
HPL	"In the centre of Sarnath they lay, covering a great space and encircled by a high wall."
HPL	"Birch acquired a limitation and changed his business in , yet never discussed the case when he could avoid it."
HPL	"Instead, they jumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills; the deafening, cataclysmic peal whose source, be it inner earth or sky, no hearer was ever able to place."
HPL	"We did not think, judging from precedent, that it would pursue us far even at worst."
HPL	"Wait till I tell yer Uncle Chris when he gits hum Ye'd orta know these here woods ain't no fitten place to be traipsin' this hour They's things abroad what dun't do nobody no good, as my gran'sir' knowed afur me."
HPL	"I found what I had half expected, that where the shunned house now stood the Roulets had laid out their graveyard behind a one story and attic cottage, and that no record of any transfer of graves existed."
HPL	"Steeled by old ordeals in dissecting rooms, the doctor entered and looked about, stifling the nausea of mind and body that everything in sight and smell induced."
HPL	"Influenced by the legends that Barry had related, my mind had in slumber hovered around a stately city in a green valley, where marble streets and statues, villas and temples, carvings and inscriptions, all spoke in certain tones the glory that was Greece."
HPL	"His father, Karl Trever, was an attorney and citizen of distinction, whilst his mother had made an enviable reputation as a poetess under her maiden name of Eleanor Wing."
HPL	"In the end he give him a funny kind o' thingumajig made aout o' lead or something, that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they might be a nest of 'em."
HPL	"As for the twentieth time or more Arthur Munroe and I went minutely over every inch of the violated village, we were filled with a certain discouragement coupled with vague and novel fears."
HPL	"""Thar's whar it all begun that cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep water starts."
HPL	"Birch, being by temperament phlegmatic and practical, did not shout long; but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of the tomb."
HPL	"The smoke of a battleship was on the northern horizon, but our distance and ability to submerge made us safe."
HPL	"Messrs. Ricci and Silva met in Water Street by the old man's front gate, and although they did not like the way the moon shone down upon the painted stones through the budding branches of the gnarled trees, they had more important things to think about than mere idle superstition."
HPL	"I had been, albeit without definite reason, instinctively on my guard and that was to my advantage in the new and real crisis, whatever it might turn out to be."
HPL	"We all hed to take the Oath o' Dagon, an' later on they was secon' an' third Oaths that some on us took."
HPL	"And peradventure it may be that Oonai the city of lutes and dancing is even the fair Aira thou seekest, for it is told that thou hast not known Aira since old days, and a name often changeth."
HPL	"Not even the mines of precious metal remained, for DOOM had come to Sarnath."
HPL	Around the first of April Gilman worried considerably because his slow fever did not abate.
HPL	"The instant he opened his eyes he knew something was terribly wrong, for he was back in his old garret room with the slanting wall and ceiling, sprawled on the now unmade bed."
HPL	"God, that hand The window The window When the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victim's body, I loved the irradiate refuge of sleep."
HPL	"The students all attended the hasty funeral on the th, and bought an impressive wreath, though the latter was quite overshadowed by the tributes sent by wealthy Arkham citizens and by the municipality itself."
HPL	"It was he who wisely advised the burgesses of Ulthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats, and who first told the young priest Atal where it is that black cats go at midnight on St. John's Eve."
HPL	"But memory never died, and high priests said that the city would rise again when the stars were right."
HPL	"This, indeed, proved to be true; and the party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it."
HPL	"Dutee himself thought little of the house, for he grew up to be a privateersman, and served with distinction on the Vigilant under Capt."
HPL	"The poor fellow was young, rather dark, and very handsome; probably an Italian or Greek, and undoubtedly of the Victory's crew."
HPL	"Either he was born in strange shadow, or he'd found a way to unlock the forbidden gate."
HPL	"For many months after that Kuranes sought the marvellous city of Celephaïs and its sky bound galleys in vain; and though his dreams carried him to many gorgeous and unheard of places, no one whom he met could tell him how to find Ooth Nargai, beyond the Tanarian Hills."
HPL	"It was the faces, Eliot, those accursed faces, that leered and slavered out of the canvas with the very breath of life By God, man, I verily believe they were alive That nauseous wizard had waked the fires of hell in pigment, and his brush had been a nightmare spawning wand."
HPL	It read as follows: MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA Vigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow.
HPL	"I say, when they git ready . . ."
HPL	"Only on closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty, the stale and prosy triteness, and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims of solid truth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most of its professors; or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of a primal race confronting the unknown."
HPL	"But as Jermyn indulged in these reflections he could not but smile at their futility, a century and a half after the death of both of his strange progenitors."
HPL	"At fust the things didn't never go onto the main island, but arter a time they come to want to."
HPL	"Its trees were all gone now, and its rose gardens were displaced by the backs of cheap, ugly new buildings on parallel streets."
HPL	"Free from unwarranted superstition though I am, these things produced in me an odd sensation, which was intensified by a pair of widely separated newspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned house one from the Providence Gazette and Country Journal of April , , and the other from the Daily Transcript and Chronicle of October , each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance whose duplication was remarkable."
HPL	"It also bore the inscription, ""From Eric Moreland Clapham Lee, St. Eloi, Flanders""."
HPL	"No, it was not there, but there was the big silver key he had found in a box somewhere."
HPL	"To be confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as I had deemed the old castle with evidence of the presence of man or spirit, produced in my brain a horror of the most acute description."
HPL	"His own face was in shadow, and he wore a wide brimmed hat which somehow blended perfectly with the out of date cloak he affected; but I was subtly disquieted even before he addressed me."
HPL	"Obed he notices, besides, that lots of the han'some young folks ud drop aout o' sight fer good from year to year, an' that they wa'n't many old folks araound."
HPL	"He had been taken there by the bubble congeries and the little polyhedron which always dogged him; but they, like himself, had changed to wisps of milky, barely luminous mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness."
HPL	"""All in Teloth must toil,"" replied the archon, ""for that is the law."""
HPL	"Its clearness was astonishing and unprecedented and as I watched I seemed to see again the thin, yellowish, shimmering exhalation which had startled me on that rainy afternoon so many years before."
HPL	"Rushing through the newly opened connexion, I succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned; but even as I did so I heard the hall door of the third room the one from whose window I had hoped to reach the roof below being tried with a pass key."
HPL	"So once more the White Ship followed the bird of heaven, over warm blessed seas fanned by caressing, aromatic breezes."
HPL	"I dun't think he aimed at fust to do no mixin', nor raise no younguns to take to the water an' turn into fishes with eternal life."
HPL	"Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in the Pacific."
HPL	"On the floor were confused muddy prints, but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the door."
HPL	"This was not much, though, for the old woman was spinning very hard, and the aged clock had been striking."
HPL	"But though men talked of great changes, The Street felt them not; for its folk were still the same, speaking of the old familiar things in the old familiar accents."
HPL	"These folk say that on a table in a bare room on the ground floor are many peculiar bottles, in each a small piece of lead suspended pendulum wise from a string."
HPL	"Still nothing occurred to reward my watching; and I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better of apprehension."
HPL	"They roared like the animals they were, and broke instruments and furniture indiscriminately; screaming about such nonsense as the curse of the ivory image and the dark dead youth who looked at them and swam away."
HPL	"Seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed Frye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless, monstrous quarry."
HPL	"Being without superstition, he did not heed the day at all; though ever afterward he refused to do anything of importance on that fateful sixth day of the week."
HPL	"In this wall was a small, low arched gate of nail studded black oak, which the man proceeded to unlock with a ponderous key."
HPL	"No longer could he share the peculiarities and prejudices of the Martenses, while the very mountain thunderstorms failed to intoxicate him as they had before."
HPL	"After many aeons men came to the land of Mnar; dark shepherd folk with their fleecy flocks, who built Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on the winding river Ai."
HPL	"But it was a hideous proof, because I knew from old papers that that watch had been buried with my great great great great grandfather in ."
HPL	"Ceasing my futile and now objectless writhing, I watched the spectators as they viewed the treasure trove, and was permitted to share in their discoveries."
HPL	It would be useless to describe the playing of Erich Zann on that dreadful night.
HPL	Know you not how the secret of Alchemy was solved?
HPL	"My friend had told me of him, and of the impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations, and I burned with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries."
HPL	"They were sensations, yet within them lay unbelievable elements of time and space things which at bottom possess no distinct and definite existence."
HPL	"So on the night of July , , Herbert West and I stood in the cellar laboratory and gazed at a white, silent figure beneath the dazzling arc light."
HPL	"Then, in spite of my daze of fright and disgust, my morbid curiosity triumphed; and as the last of the monstrosities oozed up alone from that nether world of unknown nightmare, I drew my automatic pistol and shot it under cover of the thunder."
HPL	"Had he been sleep walking within his room, and had the rat bitten him as he sat in some chair or paused in some less rational position?"
HPL	"He was trying to make a noise; to ward something off or drown something out what, I could not imagine, awesome though I felt it must be."
HPL	"I have merely set down certain things appealing to me as facts, allowing you to construe them as you will."
HPL	"Finally, with Carrington Harris's permission, I fitted a key to the disused door opening from the cellar directly upon Benefit Street, preferring to have a more immediate access to the outside world than the dark stairs, ground floor hall, and front door could give."
HPL	"Afterward I waited in the black hallway, shivering with cold and fear, till I heard the poor musician's feeble effort to rise from the floor by the aid of a chair."
HPL	"What the whole proceeding meant, I could not imagine; unless it involved some strange rite connected with Devil Reef, or unless some party had landed from a ship on that sinister rock."
HPL	"Charter Street, it turned out to be, but I was too flustered to notice just where we hit it."
HPL	"Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily."
HPL	All this he tells me yet I cannot forget what I saw in the sky on the night after Slater died.
HPL	"But all these precautions came late in the day, so that Gilman had some terrible hints from the dreaded Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred, the fragmentary Book of Eibon, and the suppressed Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt to correlate with his abstract formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known and unknown."
HPL	"As a result, these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent."
HPL	"They from outside will help, but they cannot take body without human blood."
HPL	ff ff ff FATHER FATHER YOG SOTHOTH . .
HPL	During the next few days Gilman enjoyed an almost perfect immunity from morbid manifestations.
HPL	"Sometimes they appeared to devour one another, the attacker launching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from sight."
HPL	"The thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the time."
HPL	"His eyes were pits of flame, and they glared at me with what I now saw was overwhelming hatred."
HPL	"Ye see, they was able to live both in an' aout o' water what they call amphibians, I guess."
HPL	"I would, of course, soon have to shift from Washington to some other southward street; for that party from the hotel would doubtless be after me."
HPL	"For the door and windows of the undersea temple hewn from the rocky hill were vividly aglow with a flickering radiance, as from a mighty altar flame far within."
HPL	"And yet I saw them in a limitless stream flopping, hopping, croaking, bleating surging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque, malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare."
HPL	"The man did not accost me, so I hastened home in an effort to overhear what he might report to my careworn father."
HPL	"The sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather."
HPL	"Something beyond their experience was evidently confronting them, for so far as they could ascertain, the void below was infinite."
HPL	"Reports of the coming cohort must have reached the hills, and even the lack of a final decision could not make the rumour less alarming yet there were the sinister drums as of yore, as if the celebrants had some peculiar reason to be indifferent whether or not the forces of the Roman People marched against them."
HPL	"Talks with several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many others elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear."
HPL	One September day an unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had come to repair his electric desk lamp; a fit for which he prescribed effectively whilst keeping himself well out of sight.
HPL	"Only the silent, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has lain hidden since the early days; and they are not communicative, being loath to shake off the drowsiness which helps them forget."
HPL	"It repelled him horribly, and revolted all his inherited delicacy; but his determination to taste life to the full remained with him, and he maintained a bold front."
HPL	At the same time the wolfish wind rose to daemoniac crescendoes of ululation.
HPL	"My liking for him did not grow, though the attic room and the weird music seemed to hold an odd fascination for me."
HPL	"Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken down."
HPL	"The Knight's Head had been his headquarters, and when he was confined he expressed some vague gratitude as if for protection."
HPL	"And the King bade him put away his tattered purple, and clothed him in satin and cloth of gold, with rings of green jade and bracelets of tinted ivory, and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried chamber on a bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of flower embroidered silk."
HPL	"Friends had held him when he drew a stiletto, but West departed amidst his inhuman shrieks, curses, and oaths of vengeance."
HPL	"I was not sufficiently awake to see whether Tobey was attending to his duties as sentinel, but felt a distinct anxiety on that score."
HPL	"Dr. Johnson, as I beheld him, was a full, pursy Man, very ill drest, and of slovenly Aspect."
HPL	"There was the immemorial figure of the deputy or messenger of hidden and terrible powers the ""Black Man"" of the witch cult, and the ""Nyarlathotep"" of the Necronomicon."
HPL	"He says they brung us fish an' treasure, an' shud hev what they hankered arter. . . ."
HPL	"Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few."
HPL	Then came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window that looked out high above the other roofs of the city.
HPL	"A sad faced woman in black answered my summons, and I was stung with disappointment when she told me in halting English that Gustaf Johansen was no more."
HPL	"For that very fresh body, at last writhing into full and terrifying consciousness with eyes dilated at the memory of its last scene on earth, threw out its frantic hands in a life and death struggle with the air; and suddenly collapsing into a second and final dissolution from which there could be no return, screamed out the cry that will ring eternally in my aching brain: ""Help Keep off, you cursed little tow head fiend keep that damned needle away from me"" V."
HPL	"I looked at the closed eyelids, and thought I detected a quivering."
HPL	"His aspect and voice became utterly frightful, and his presence almost unbearable."
HPL	"They say there is no land of Lomar, save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in those realms where the Pole Star shines high and red Aldebaran crawls low around the horizon, there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of years, and never a man save squat yellow creatures, blighted by the cold, whom they call ""Esquimaux""."
HPL	"Musides, weeping, promised him a sepulchre more lovely than the tomb of Mausolus; but Kalos bade him speak no more of marble glories."
HPL	"For three days they climbed higher, higher, and higher toward the roof of the world; then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moon."
HPL	"Gilman had a constant sense of dread that it might rise to some unbearable degree of intensity during one or another of its obscure, relentlessly inevitable fluctuations."
HPL	"Those organic entities whose motions seemed least flagrantly irrelevant and unmotivated were probably projections of life forms from our own planet, including human beings."
HPL	"In his dream delirium Gilman heard the hellish, alien rhythmed chant of the Sabbat coming from an infinite distance, and knew the black man must be there."
HPL	"""Right naow Barnabas is abaout changed."
HPL	"I had read many scrolls out of Syria and Ægyptus, and the cryptic towns of Etruria, and had talked at length with the bloodthirsty priest of Diana Aricina in his temple in the woods bordering Lacus Nemorensis."
HPL	There was a gradual deterioration I had not foreseen.
HPL	"Ahead lay sparse grass and scrub blueberry bushes, and beyond them the naked rock of the crag and the thin peak of the dreaded grey cottage."
HPL	"Then one night the red and fattened Romnod snorted heavily amidst the poppied silks of his banquet couch and died writhing, whilst Iranon, pale and slender, sang to himself in a far corner."
HPL	"In his glance there is not any restless light, and if he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin horns it is only at night when old dreams are wandering."
HPL	"Of Gerrit Martense's descendants less is known than of himself; since they were all reared in hatred of the English civilisation, and trained to shun such of the colonists as accepted it."
HPL	"The results of this examination were not at first very enlightening, though our tabulation of them seemed to reveal a fairly significant trend; namely, that the number of reported horrors was by far the greatest in areas either comparatively near the avoided house or connected with it by stretches of the morbidly overnourished forest."
HPL	"I should not have ventured out that night; for the taint of thunder was in the clouds, and a hellish phosphorescence rose from the rank swamp at the bottom of the hollow."
HPL	"Whither he has gone, I do not know; but I have gone home to the pure New England lanes up which fragrant sea winds sweep at evening."
HPL	"After the fading of the last match I dared to waste, I sat very quietly without a light."
HPL	"""That was before my time before the new squire's time."
HPL	"Gilman tried to stop up the rat hole every day, but each night the real tenants of the partitions would gnaw away the obstruction, whatever it might be."
HPL	"I looked at Zann, and saw that he was past conscious observation."
HPL	"They found Gilman on the floor of his queerly angled old garret room long before dawn, for the terrible cry had brought Desrochers and Choynski and Dombrowski and Mazurewicz at once, and had even wakened the soundly sleeping Elwood in his chair."
HPL	"Vast, Polyphemus like, and loathsome, it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith, about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms, the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds."
HPL	"Its contents were of the most startling nature, and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my apprehensions."
HPL	"And what damnable expressiveness Pickman sometimes gave the sightless faces of this charnel booty Occasionally the things were shewn leaping through open windows at night, or squatting on the chests of sleepers, worrying at their throats."
HPL	Nor has he yet had any difficulty in obtaining tenants.
HPL	"Subsequently he seemed to be satisfied, and crossing to a chair by the table wrote a brief note, handed it to me, and returned to the table, where he began to write rapidly and incessantly."
HPL	In the morning citizens and state troopers followed the shuddering mountaineers to the place where they said the death had come.
HPL	Among the rubbish which had crashed through the ancient slanting ceiling were several things which made the workmen pause and call in the police.
HPL	"In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods."
HPL	"Elihu Whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws he had preached as a physician, and but for what happened later would be here in full vigour today."
HPL	"Its voice was a kind of loathsome titter, and it could speak all languages."
HPL	I shivered as the cracked stroke of three sounded from a belfry on my left.
HPL	"There were only three passengers dark, unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful cast and when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up State Street in a silent, almost furtive fashion."
HPL	"Though well above the middle stature, and of somewhat brawny frame, he was given an absurd appearance of harmless stupidity by the pale, sleepy blueness of his small watery eyes, the scantiness of his neglected and never shaven growth of yellow beard, and the listless drooping of his heavy nether lip."
HPL	"The two sounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters ""Cthulhu"" and ""R'lyeh""."
HPL	"Honest, wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly, and in my genealogical researches I had encountered legends of a century before which biassed me against places of this kind."
HPL	"Gradually I had come to be his inseparable assistant, and now that we were out of college we had to keep together."
HPL	"A bowl of vegetable soup with crackers was enough for me, and I soon headed back for my cheerless room at the Gilman; getting an evening paper and a flyspecked magazine from the evil visaged clerk at the rickety stand beside his desk."
HPL	"Especially was it unwise to rave of the living things that might haunt such a place; of creatures half of the jungle and half of the impiously aged city fabulous creatures which even a Pliny might describe with scepticism; things that might have sprung up after the great apes had overrun the dying city with the walls and the pillars, the vaults and the weird carvings."
HPL	"""To my ancestor "" he softly continued, ""there appeared to reside some very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind; qualities having a little suspected dominance not only over the acts of one's self and of others, but over every variety of force and substance in Nature, and over many elements and dimensions deemed more univarsal than Nature herself."
HPL	"They have a trim bungalow now at Bristol Highlands, where no tall crags tower, and the neighbours are urban and modern."
HPL	"He knew deeper vices through books, and he now longed to know them at first hand."
HPL	"He wants to see life as she is wants to know what the real lightnin' juice tastes like so jus' remember he's me friend an' treat 'im right."""
HPL	"In relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement within this refuge for the demented, I am aware that my present position will create a natural doubt of the authenticity of my narrative."
HPL	"Of graves and tombs I knew and imagined much, but had on account of my peculiar temperament been kept from all personal contact with churchyards and cemeteries."
HPL	"""Never was nobody like Cap'n Obed old limb o' Satan Heh, heh I kin mind him a tellin' abaout furren parts, an' callin' all the folks stupid fer goin' to Christian meetin' an' bearin' their burdens meek an' lowly."
HPL	A paralysis of fear stifled all attempts to cry out.
HPL	"One side of the cobblestoned open space was the straight line of the river; the other was a semicircle of slant roofed brick buildings of about the period, from which several streets radiated away to the southeast, south, and southwest."
HPL	"We had not been settled a week before we got an accident victim on the very night of burial, and made it open its eyes with an amazingly rational expression before the solution failed."
HPL	So matters went till that night when Williams brought home the infamous Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred.
HPL	"Scenes were blocked out with extreme care, and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which Pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions."
HPL	"Thereafter I heard Zann every night, and although he kept me awake, I was haunted by the weirdness of his music."
HPL	"Trade fallin' off, mills losin' business even the new ones an' the best of our menfolks kilt a privateerin' in the War of or lost with the Elizy brig an' the Ranger snow both of 'em Gilman venters."
HPL	"It sounded so unnatural slopping like, he said that he didn't dare undress and go to sleep."
HPL	"Afternoon was far gone when he reached the foot, and at the bend half way up he paused to scan the outspread countryside golden and glorified in the slanting floods of magic poured out by a western sun."
HPL	I hate the moon I am afraid of it for when it shines on certain scenes familiar and loved it sometimes makes them unfamiliar and hideous.
HPL	"He watched and listened with his mind more than with his eyes and ears, and strove every moment to drown something in his ceaseless poring over gay, insipid novels."
HPL	"The youth's febrile mind, apparently, was dwelling on strange things; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them."
HPL	"And when the day dawned, rosy and effulgent, I beheld the green shore of far lands, bright and beautiful, and to me unknown."
HPL	"They were definite and unmistakable, and awaked in my mind a blind horror beyond all rational proportion."
HPL	"Sewers came, but they passed by it."
HPL	"They were a kind of fugue, with recurrent passages of the most captivating quality, but to me were notable for the absence of any of the weird notes I had overheard from my room below on other occasions."
HPL	"It was a repulsive task that we undertook in the black small hours, even though we lacked at that time the special horror of graveyards which later experiences brought to us."
HPL	"We entered, and as we did so I grew faint from a reek of infinite mustiness which welled out to meet us, and which must have been the fruit of unwholesome centuries of decay."
HPL	The other face may wear off some.
HPL	Presently he realised what he was listening for the hellish chant of the celebrants in the distant black valley.
HPL	"Something in the Martenses' manner gave Gifford a feeling of repulsion and suspicion, and a week later he returned with spade and mattock to explore the sepulchral spot."
HPL	"It may have been wholly an hallucination from the shock caused at that instant by the sudden and complete destruction of the building in a cataclysm of German shell fire who can gainsay it, since West and I were the only proved survivors?"
HPL	Now the irony is this.
HPL	"An' that ain't the wust, nuther."
HPL	"After the clock had struck three the moon shone in my eyes, but I turned over without rising to pull down the shade."
HPL	"But he did not mind his multitude of guests; indeed, he seemed to dread being alone now that his absorbing work was done."
HPL	Then suddenly I saw it.
HPL	"Around me were the tombs and the darkness and the shadows; below me, some peril beyond the radius of the human imagination."
HPL	"He beckoned me into a low, candle lit room with massive exposed rafters and dark, stiff, sparse furniture of the seventeenth century."
HPL	"He was clad in dressing gown and slippers, and had in his hands a revolver and an electric flashlight."
HPL	"The effect of this volume had not left me, and I felt a certain hesitancy in speaking of it; but curiosity overmastered all the vague fears which had steadily accumulated since my first glimpse of the house."
HPL	"I wondered what sights this placid youth might have seen in inaccessible spheres, and what he could relate if fully restored to life."
HPL	"I likewise did much of his shopping, and gasped in bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and laboratory supply houses."
HPL	"The beldame's face was alight with inhuman exultation, and the little yellow toothed morbidity tittered mockingly as it pointed at the heavily sleeping form of Elwood on the other couch across the room."
HPL	In our sensible age since the Dunwich horror of was hushed up by those who had the town's and the world's welfare at heart people shun it without knowing exactly why.
HPL	"I moved toward the window and would have drawn aside the nondescript curtains, when with a frightened rage even greater than before the dumb lodger was upon me again; this time motioning with his head toward the door as he nervously strove to drag me thither with both hands."
HPL	"With only a slight churning to mark its rise to the surface, the thing slid into view above the dark waters."
HPL	"""Gawd,"" he gasped, ""I telled 'em not ter go daown into the glen, an' I never thought nobody'd dew it with them tracks an' that smell an' the whippoorwills a screechin' daown thar in the dark o' noonday. . ."
HPL	One detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few faint sounds I heard.
HPL	"With great diligence did men of hidden badges linger and listen about such places as Petrovitch's Bakery, the squalid Rifkin School of Modern Economics, the Circle Social Club, and the Liberty Café."
HPL	"That object no larger than a good sized rat and quaintly called by the townspeople ""Brown Jenkin"" seemed to have been the fruit of a remarkable case of sympathetic herd delusion, for in no less than eleven persons had testified to glimpsing it."
HPL	"A spark appeared on the moor, a flame arose, and a pillar of human fire reached to the heavens."
HPL	"And that night my dreams of piping flutes and marble peristyles came to a sudden and disquieting end; for upon the city in the valley I saw a pestilence descend, and then a frightful avalanche of wooded slopes that covered the dead bodies in the streets and left unburied only the temple of Artemis on the high peak, where the aged moon priestess Cleis lay cold and silent with a crown of ivory on her silver head."
HPL	"""The end,"" ran that noisome scrawl, ""is here."
HPL	Then one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain crest and looked down upon the myriad lights of Oonai.
HPL	"Let somebody lead the way I don't know your roads very well, but I've an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots."
HPL	"And against the rotting wharves the sea pounded; the secretive, immemorial sea out of which the people had come in the elder time."
HPL	Suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any discernible cloud.
HPL	"For several hours I sat thinking or brooding in the boat, which lay upon its side and afforded a slight shade as the sun moved across the heavens."
HPL	"And yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the Inspector's problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew."
HPL	"That idol, enshrined in the high temple at Ilarnek, was subsequently worshipped beneath the gibbous moon throughout the land of Mnar."
HPL	But perhaps this was all madness.
HPL	In that coffin and in that vault they have promised me I shall be buried.
HPL	"When I heard the fears which had driven the people from Kilderry I laughed as loudly as my friend had laughed, for these fears were of the vaguest, wildest, and most absurd character."

HPL	"But as I stood in the tower's topmost chamber, I beheld the horned waning moon, red and sinister, quivering through the vapours that hovered over the distant valley of Banof."
HPL	"This no human creature may do; for lacking the fellowship of the living, he inevitably draws upon the companionship of things that are not, or are no longer, living."
HPL	"""You know,"" he said, ""there are things that won't do for Newbury Street things that are out of place here, and that can't be conceived here, anyhow."
HPL	Had he signed the black man's book after all?
HPL	"They climb to the moonlit towers of ruined Rhine castles, and falter down black cobwebbed steps beneath the scattered stones of forgotten cities in Asia."
HPL	"Once I went up to the garret during theatre hours, when Zann was away, but the door was locked."
HPL	"It was dismal sitting there on rickety boxes in the pitchy darkness, but we smoked pipes and occasionally flashed our pocket lamps about."
HPL	"Old Kranon, the burgomaster, swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of Menes' kitten; and cursed the caravan and the little boy."
HPL	As he walked toward the bus I observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense.
HPL	"Many covered their eyes with their hands, and plunged blindly and awkwardly in their race to escape; overturning furniture and stumbling against the walls before they managed to reach one of the many doors."
HPL	"I do not try, gentlemen, to account for that thing that voice nor can I venture to describe it in detail, since the first words took away my consciousness and created a mental blank which reaches to the time of my awakening in the hospital."
HPL	"But I was not afraid long, for the gowned, slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that reassured me; and though he made signs that he was dumb, he wrote a quaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carried."
HPL	"That shocking little horror was reserved for certain lighter, sharper dreams which assailed him just before he dropped into the fullest depths of sleep."
HPL	When Gilman climbed up a ladder to the cobwebbed level loft above the rest of the attic he found vestiges of a bygone aperture tightly and heavily covered with ancient planking and secured by the stout wooden pegs common in colonial carpentry.
HPL	"They say, too, that the fierce aurora comes oftener to that spot, shining blue in the north with visions of frozen worlds while the crag and the cottage hang black and fantastic against wild coruscations."
HPL	"There was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry."
HPL	"The soldiers were the fifth cohort of the XIIth legion, under the military tribune Sex."
HPL	"A single lightning bolt shot from the purple zenith to the altar stone, and a great tidal wave of viewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside."
HPL	"It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found in the swamp."
HPL	"He was again in the cramped, violet litten peaked space with the slanting floor, the low cases of ancient books, the bench and table, the queer objects, and the triangular gulf at one side."
HPL	"One thing I began to suspect, and which I now fear I know, is that my uncle's death was far from natural."
HPL	"Now, in my intense desire to probe into the dream life of Joe Slater, I sought these instruments again; and spent several days in repairing them for action."
HPL	"The shaft of light entered the door at an upward angle, and I peered in to see if I could glimpse anything, but all in vain."
HPL	For a moment I simply held my breath and waited.
HPL	"It was his view that only our normal, objective experiences possess any aesthetic significance, and that it is the province of the artist not so much to rouse strong emotion by action, ecstasy, and astonishment, as to maintain a placid interest and appreciation by accurate, detailed transcripts of every day affairs."
HPL	"""Nobody around here or in Arkham or Ipswich will have anything to do with 'em, and they act kind of offish themselves when they come to town or when anyone tries to fish on their grounds."
HPL	"I have always believed that such strange, inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows, and now I believe I have found a way to break down the barriers."
HPL	During the day the patient regained consciousness at times and whispered his newest dream disjointedly to Elwood.
HPL	"I moved my hand to his head, whose mechanical nodding I was able to stop, and shouted in his ear that we must both flee from the unknown things of the night."
HPL	"There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration."
HPL	"And I have read more of these things, and of many things besides, in the books men gave me when I was young and filled with wonder."
HPL	"It had to be done my way artificial preservation for you see I died that time eighteen years ago."""
HPL	"dee"" Randolph Carter stopped in the pitch darkness and rubbed his hand across his eyes."
HPL	"The one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as I could, and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby."
HPL	"He vows that I was broken down with nervous strain, and badly in need of the long vacation on full pay which he so generously gave me."
HPL	I might never have known Dr. Muñoz had it not been for the heart attack that suddenly seized me one forenoon as I sat writing in my room.
HPL	"But most of the men of Teloth yawned, and some laughed and some went away to sleep; for Iranon told nothing useful, singing only his memories, his dreams, and his hopes."

HPL	"Ronald Hill, only to be shot down when directly over his destination."

HPL	"The first revelation led to an exhaustive research, and finally to that shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine."
HPL	"""Oh, thet Afriky book?"
HPL	"The narrow transom admitted only the feeblest of rays, and the overhead ventilation funnel virtually none at all; so that he was reduced to a profane fumbling as he made his halting way among the long boxes toward the latch."
HPL	"Then, slowly advancing to meet the Comte, he pronounced in dull yet terrible accents the curse that ever afterward haunted the house of C ."
HPL	"So each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall, though it was exceedingly well hidden."
HPL	"In his boyhood he had revelled through long visits there, and had found weird marvels in the woods beyond the orchard."
HPL	"The pavement from which he easily raised himself was of a veined, polished stone beyond his power to identify, and the tiles were cut in bizarre angled shapes which struck him as less asymmetrical than based on some unearthly symmetry whose laws he could not comprehend."
HPL	"It was so old, he added, that no one now could be expected to recognise it."
HPL	"There had, Mr. Peabody said, been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father, Benjamin Orne, just after the Civil War; since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling."

HPL	"That the danger to the town and inhabitants of Pompelo was a real one, I could not from my studies doubt."
HPL	"Again I tried to read, but found that I made no progress."

HPL	"So as the hour grew dangerously near to dawn, we did as we had done with the others dragged the thing across the meadows to the neck of the woods near the potter's field, and buried it there in the best sort of grave the frozen ground would furnish."
HPL	"There was some of it in Wilbur Whateley himself enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight."
HPL	"That man, oddly enough, had been through the terrors of the Great War without having incurred any fright so thorough."
HPL	"Then suddenly I came by a rare piece of chance, since it was not in the main body of records and might easily have been missed upon something which aroused my keenest eagerness, fitting in as it did with several of the queerest phases of the affair."
HPL	"So the youth answered: ""I am Iranon, and come from Aira, a far city that I recall only dimly but seek to find again."
HPL	Arthur Jermyn was the son of Sir Alfred Jermyn and a music hall singer of unknown origin.
HPL	"I began to realise how some of poor Klenze's moods had arisen, for as the temple drew me more and more, I feared its aqueous abysses with a blind and mounting terror."
HPL	"But after a time his alcohol enfeebled brain would wander from the subject, and with a foolish grin he would turn once more to his mop or cleaning rag."
HPL	"The aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety."
HPL	"Later, it seems, he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage her, but were beaten about by the storm of April nd."
HPL	"There was some talk of searching the woods, but most of the family's friends were busy with the dead woman and the screaming man."
HPL	"Then he collapsed, an inert mass of mangled flesh."
HPL	"It was Maurice who, in the poet's st year, secured the adoption of his work as a textbook in the schools of the empire, an honour which proved a fatal tax on the aged rhetorician's emotions, since he passed away peacefully at his home near the church of St. Sophia on the sixth day before the Kalends of September, A.D. , in the nd year of his age."
HPL	"Then, on Wednesday, the great shock came."
HPL	"I had not entered the army on my own initiative, but rather as a natural result of the enlistment of the man whose indispensable assistant I was the celebrated Boston surgical specialist, Dr. Herbert West."
HPL	"The tension was aggravated by the disappearance of Müller and Zimmer, who undoubtedly committed suicide as a result of the fears which had seemed to harass them, though they were not observed in the act of jumping overboard."
HPL	"And the day wore on, and still Olney listened to rumours of old times and far places, and heard how the Kings of Atlantis fought with the slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in ocean's floor, and how the pillared and weedy temple of Poseidonis is still glimpsed at midnight by lost ships, who know by its sight that they are lost."
HPL	"Later the god and the princess had returned, and upon the death of the princess her divine husband had mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house of stone, where it was worshipped."

HPL	"Our seat on the tomb was very comfortable, and I knew that my prosaic friend would not mind the cavernous rift in the ancient, root disturbed brickwork close behind us, or the utter blackness of the spot brought by the intervention of a tottering, deserted seventeenth century house between us and the nearest lighted road."
HPL	"His frightened horse had gone home, but his frightened wits never quite did that."
HPL	"The next afternoon a dense flock of sea birds appeared from the south, and the ocean began to heave ominously."
HPL	"At first the syllables defied all correlation with any speech of earth, but toward the last there came some disjointed fragments evidently taken from the Necronomicon, that monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished."

HPL	"At length the decrepit vehicle started with a jerk, and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of State Street amidst a cloud of vapour from the exhaust."
HPL	But I was then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor.
HPL	"Despite a strong physical resemblance to his father, his appearance and conduct were in many particulars so coarse that he was universally shunned."
HPL	"At another time I felt the huge animate things brushing past me and occasionally walking or drifting through my supposedly solid body, and thought I saw Tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually."
HPL	"""Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it."
HPL	"It was to a time battered edifice of this description that I was driven one afternoon in November, , by a rain of such chilling copiousness that any shelter was preferable to exposure."
HPL	"It was then that I saw the tumbledown fire station on my left, and noticed the red faced, bushy bearded, watery eyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormal looking firemen."
HPL	"The lodgers and police on that night soothed me, and the doctor administered something to quiet me, nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place."
HPL	"The Thing cannot be described there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order."
HPL	"He was very deliberate, and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said."
HPL	I had spent the better part of the morning in climbing up and down half ruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated of the ancient turrets.
HPL	Tradition emphasises the uselessness of material barriers in halting a witch's motions; and who can say what underlies the old tales of broomstick rides through the night?
HPL	"And inside that rusted iron strait jacket lurked gibbering hideousness, perversion, and diabolism."
HPL	"On the right and left, however, some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel; their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourth story level."
HPL	"The eminent critic and biographer was born in the year , shortly after the extinction of the Roman rule in Gaul by Clovis."

HPL	"Past, present, future, all are one in Yog Sothoth."
HPL	"I was willing enough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and uncertain; but now that it is an old story, with public interest and curiosity gone, I have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in that ill rumoured and evilly shadowed seaport of death and blasphemous abnormality."
HPL	"He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and recalled the old Sunday stories in the Advertiser; these things, and the lore he had picked up from Dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there."

HPL	"The reception of his request seems to have been varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary."
HPL	"Then beyond the hill's crest I saw Kingsport outspread frostily in the gloaming; snowy Kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples, ridgepoles and chimney pots, wharves and small bridges, willow trees and graveyards; endless labyrinths of steep, narrow, crooked streets, and dizzy church crowned central peak that time durst not touch; ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles and levels like a child's disordered blocks; antiquity hovering on grey wings over winter whitened gables and gambrel roofs; fanlights and small paned windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to join Orion and the archaic stars."
HPL	"Erring as all mortals must, they were forced by their rigid code to seek concealment above all else; so that they came to use less and less taste in what they concealed."

HPL	"But I was saved by the very thunder that had summoned it, for after a hideous wait there burst from the unseen outside sky one of those frequent mountainward bolts whose aftermath I had noticed here and there as gashes of disturbed earth and fulgurites of various sizes."
HPL	"As I gained this respite I heard the battering at the two other doors abate, while a confused clatter came from the connecting door I had shielded with the bedstead."
HPL	"I heard a clock strike somewhere not ours, for that was not a striking clock and my morbid fancy found in this a new starting point for idle wanderings."
HPL	"It was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion, and dabbled in the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote for the commonplace."
HPL	He did not wish to go to sleep in a room alone especially since he thought he had glimpsed in the evening twilight the repellent old woman whose image had become so horribly transferred to his dreams.

HPL	"Then, after a short interval, the form in the corner stirred; and may pitying heaven keep from my sight and sound another thing like that which took place before me."
HPL	"The man had always shivered when he read this scroll, and Carter shivered now."
HPL	"As Kalos grew inexplicably weaker and weaker despite the ministrations of puzzled physicians and of his assiduous friend, he desired to be carried often to the grove which he so loved."

HPL	A smell of oil was all that came up from the regions below.
HPL	"Again groping toward the street, I opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows."
HPL	After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side.
