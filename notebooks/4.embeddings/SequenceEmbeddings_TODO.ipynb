    "|1|Mom of a Croc|At the Nile River, zoologists Chris and Martin Kratt (voiced by their real-world selves) are on a mission to show one of their fellow Wild Kratts team members—brilliant young inventor Aviva Corcovado (Athena Karkanis)—that there's more to crocodiles than just violence and snapping jaws. After shrinking themselves down to a few inches tall by using Aviva's Miniaturizer invention, the Kratt Brothers disguise themselves as crocodile eggs and sneak into a mother crocodile's new nest. In the Wild Kratts team's turtle-shaped aircraft and headquarters—the Tortuga, one of Aviva's greatest inventions—the Wild Kratts tech team, consisting of Aviva, communications expert and mechanic Koki (Heather Bambrick), and skilled pilot Jimmy Z (Jonathan Malen) monitor Chris and Martin and watch as the mother crocodile faithfully guards her nest against predators for months without even eating anything. Eventually, as the crocodile eggs hatch and the crocodile mom uses her mouth to carry several of her newly hatched babies to the river, Aviva changes her mind about crocodiles and decides that these reptiles are in fact caring and dedicated mothers. But when the mother crocodile leaves the river to go get more hatchlings from her nest, predators threaten the first batch of baby crocodiles. The Kratt Brothers must use the incredible Creature Power Suits—two of Aviva's inventions—to gain the abilities of crocodiles and protect the vulnerable crocodile hatchlings.|\n",
    "|2|Whale of a Squid|The Kratt Brothers use Aviva's amphipod-inspired submersible, the Amphisub, to dive into the deep waters of the Southern Ocean. There, they witness a never-before-seen wildlife moment: a battle between a sperm whale and a giant squid. However, the water pressure at the extreme depths where the battle is taking place badly damages and partially crushes the Amphisub, forcing Aviva to use her new ExtendoArm invention to pull the submersible back to the Tortuga. To allow Chris and Martin to return to the site of the whale-versus-squid battle, Aviva programs two new Creature Power Suits—Sperm Whale Power for Chris, and Squid Power for Martin. The Kratt Brothers use their new Creature Powers to dive back into the deep sea, where the sperm whale and the giant squid are still locked in combat. Suddenly, the sperm whale becomes entangled in a discarded fishing net and begins sinking toward an area full of underwater volcanoes. To make matters worse, a colossal squid attacks the sperm whale's calf. Chris and Martin must put their Creature Powers of both sperm whale and squid to good use to rescue the mother sperm whale and her calf.|\n"
