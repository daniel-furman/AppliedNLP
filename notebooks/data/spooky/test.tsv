HPL	"Bolton had a surprisingly good police force for so small a town, and I could not help fearing the mess which would ensue if the affair of the night before were ever tracked down."
HPL	At the last moment I decided I had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average Innsmouth native.
HPL	Foreigners and credulous grandmothers are equally garrulous about the modern nickel crucifix with broken chain mixed in the rubbish and shiveringly identified by Joe Mazurewicz as that which he had given poor Gilman many years before.
HPL	"At first astonished and startled, considering the lack of response to my recent knocking at the door, I immediately afterward concluded that the walker had just awakened from a sound sleep; and listened with less surprise as the footsteps sounded on the creaking stairs."
HPL	"On the afternoon of June , as reported by wireless to the U , bound for Kiel, we torpedoed the British freighter Victory, New York to Liverpool, in N. Latitude , W. Longitude ; permitting the crew to leave in boats in order to obtain a good cinema view for the admiralty records."
HPL	"I now observed that I had with me an electric lantern and two spades, whilst my companion was supplied with a similar lantern and a portable telephone outfit."
HPL	"Then, without warning, I saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef."
HPL	"That is, never no full blooded one."
HPL	A definite point among the stars had a claim on him and was calling him.
HPL	"It is well that the reader accept nothing which follows as objective truth, for since the events transcend natural law, they are necessarily the subjective and unreal creations of my overtaxed mind."
HPL	"The hour was one of approaching triumph, for was not my fellow being escaping at last from a degrading periodic bondage; escaping forever, and preparing to follow the accursed oppressor even unto the uttermost fields of ether, that upon it might be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres?"
HPL	"A full thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them, wherein the high priests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the kings."
HPL	"That cult would never die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth."
HPL	It is perhaps worth mentioning that I was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the vault.
HPL	"I was faint, even fainter than the hateful modernity of that accursed city had made me."
HPL	Is it possible that even my latest fear is sheer delusion?
HPL	"We both inserted the whole unopened wooden box, closed the door, and started the electricity."
HPL	"This was a matter for speculation, though one could be fairly certain that the type of mutation involved in a passage from any given dimensional plane to the next higher plane would not be destructive of biological integrity as we understand it."
HPL	"The matter of the presumably weak heart, which to my mind imperiled the success of our experiment, did not appear to trouble West extensively."
HPL	"And sometimes at sunset I would climb the long hilly street to the citadel and the open place, and look down upon Aira, the magic city of marble and beryl, splendid in a robe of golden flame."
HPL	"I began to speak to Tillinghast, and as I did so all the unusual impressions abruptly vanished."
HPL	I mention his talk about angles because it suggests something Wilcox had told me of his awful dreams.
HPL	"Wealthy beyond the necessity of a commercial life, and temperamentally unfitted for the formal studies and social recreations of my acquaintances, I have dwelt ever in realms apart from the visible world; spending my youth and adolescence in ancient and little known books, and in roaming the fields and groves of the region near my ancestral home."
HPL	"Some unknown attraction was pulling his eyes in a seemingly irrelevant direction, for he could not help staring at a certain vacant spot on the floor."
HPL	"Death is merciful, for there is no return therefrom, but with him who has come back out of the nethermost chambers of night, haggard and knowing, peace rests nevermore."
HPL	"Johansen and his men landed at a sloping mud bank on this monstrous Acropolis, and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase."
HPL	"When one came to think of it, it was generally only rather young people who were seen about in public, and of these the oldest were apt to be the most tainted looking."
HPL	The house of Jermyn no longer existed.
HPL	"Whilst Musides revelled by night amidst the urban gaieties of Tegea, Kalos would remain at home; stealing away from the sight of his slaves into the cool recesses of the olive grove."
HPL	"As I have said, it happened when we were in the medical school, where West had already made himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the possibility of overcoming it artificially."
HPL	I know what has happened.
HPL	"And yet the men in olive drab will always remember that night, and will speak of The Street as they tell of it to their grandchildren; for many of them were sent there toward morning on a mission unlike that which they had expected."
HPL	"Some o' these here critters looks like monkeys, or half monkeys an' half men, but I never heerd o' nothing like this un."""
HPL	The old woman always appeared out of thin air near the corner where the downward slant met the inward slant.
HPL	I hadn't been able to give him much of my opinions I was too speechless with fright and loathing but I think he fully understood and felt highly complimented.
HPL	"Awestruck at this unexpected glimpse into a past beyond the conception of the most daring anthropologist, I stood musing whilst the moon cast queer reflections on the silent channel before me."
HPL	"The thing, it was averred, was biologically impossible to start with; merely another of those crazy country mutterings which Cotton Mather had been gullible enough to dump into his chaotic Magnalia Christi Americana, and so poorly authenticated that even he had not ventured to name the locality where the horror occurred."
HPL	"This was April th, and with the dusk would come the hellish Sabbat time which all the foreigners and the superstitious old folk feared."
HPL	West was not even excited now.
HPL	"He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again."
HPL	"There was much more than I could remember, but even what I did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever I dared write it down."
HPL	"They lived in immense houses along Washington Street, and several were reputed to harbour in concealment certain living kinsfolk whose personal aspect forbade public view, and whose deaths had been reported and recorded."
HPL	"Some of the sounds came from the south, yet I retained my design of escaping in that direction."
HPL	"He talked but little, and usually in the common jargon of the underworld; but occasionally, when inflamed by an unusually generous dose of crude whiskey, would burst forth into strings of incomprehensible polysyllables and snatches of sonorous prose and verse which led certain habitués to conjecture that he had seen better days."
HPL	"After a number of calculations West decided that it represented some secret chamber beneath the tomb of the Averills, where the last interment had been made in ."
HPL	"Besides, would not an escape from a dream loft bring him merely into a dream house an abnormal projection of the actual place he sought?"
HPL	"One could develop all sorts of aural delusions in this morbid old house for did not Gilman himself, even in daylight, now feel certain that noises other than rat scratchings came from the black voids beyond the slanting wall and above the slanting ceiling?"
HPL	"There was, too, the baffling problem of the lesser messengers or intermediaries the quasi animals and queer hybrids which legend depicts as witches' familiars."
HPL	"He had shewn little regret when shut into the barred room at Huntingdon, for his mind moved curiously."
HPL	"I, on the other hand, renewed my demand for action, and offered to accompany the cohort on any expedition it might undertake."
HPL	"Only an effort halted him at a cafeteria in Church Street, and after the meal he felt the unknown pull still more strongly."
HPL	"I dream of a day when they may rise above the billows to drag down in their reeking talons the remnants of puny, war exhausted mankind of a day when the land shall sink, and the dark ocean floor shall ascend amidst universal pandemonium."
HPL	"About noon I encountered a suitable supply house far downtown, and at approximately : p.m. arrived at my boarding place with the necessary paraphernalia and two sturdy and intelligent mechanics."
HPL	"At that moment, as I say, I was elated with the conviction that the one great goal had been attained; and that for the first time a reanimated corpse had uttered distinct words impelled by actual reason."
HPL	"The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be."
HPL	"Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly."
HPL	"Having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp cult worshippers his men had arrested, he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist Esquimaux."
HPL	He was wholly bewildered as to the relation betwixt dream and reality in all his experiences.
HPL	"The image on the monolith, of course, was carefully removed and carried back by Legrasse."
HPL	"The whole cohort now remained at a standstill, and as the torches faded I watched what I thought were fantastic shadows outlined in the sky by the spectral luminosity of the Via Lactea as it flowed through Perseus, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, and Cygnus."
HPL	"Dr. Barnard, who had been watching the patient, thought he noticed in the pale blue eyes a certain gleam of peculiar quality; and in the flaccid lips an all but imperceptible tightening, as if of intelligent determination."
HPL	"""More space, Willy, more space soon."
HPL	They were so hideously silent; there was hardly a squeal when one of the last stragglers turned with the skill of long practice to make a meal in accustomed fashion on a weaker companion.
HPL	"It was the ultimate product of mammalian degeneration; the frightful outcome of isolated spawning, multiplication, and cannibal nutrition above and below the ground; the embodiment of all the snarling chaos and grinning fear that lurk behind life."
HPL	How could any backwoods dullard have gained so much as an idea of those glittering realms of supernal radiance and space about which Slater ranted in his furious delirium?
HPL	"Indeed, had they not themselves, in their high tower, often performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of Bokrug, the water lizard?"
HPL	"From the watchman's cabin, however, gleamed a small square of yellow light like a guardian eye."
HPL	The talk went on most all night.
HPL	"They arrested me because the revolver was in my hand, but released me in three hours, after they found it was apoplexy which had finished Tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor."
HPL	"A swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from sight, and he shrank from the thought of the sounds that might surge out of that vapour."
HPL	"Legrasse for some time lent the image to Professor Webb, but at the latter's death it was returned to him and remains in his possession, where I viewed it not long ago."
HPL	"Thus ran his discourse, until with the greatest suddenness he ceased."
HPL	"Being ordered peremptorily to turn back, Capt."
HPL	He's the beatin'est boy fer runnin' off in the woods I ever see; haff the time a settin' moonin' raound that snake den in the upper timber lot . . .
HPL	"He had told her no more than he had told the public, but had left a long manuscript of ""technical matters"" as he said written in English, evidently in order to safeguard her from the peril of casual perusal."
HPL	"As the Comte and his associates turned away from the lowly abode of the alchemists, the form of Charles Le Sorcier appeared through the trees."
HPL	"I glanced back at the sea, but there was nothing there."
HPL	"Instead, she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned about, and had leaped to a realm whose wonders destined for him as well he had spurned with a smoking pistol."
HPL	"It is natural that such a thing as a dead man's scream should give horror, for it is obviously not a pleasing or ordinary occurrence; but I was used to similar experiences, hence suffered on this occasion only because of a particular circumstance."
HPL	And now Sefton Asylum has had the mishap and West has vanished.
HPL	"The water far below was very abundant, and I could see two vigorous sets of falls upstream on my right and at least one downstream on my left."
HPL	"Armitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to expect; but he did not add to the fright of the Dunwich people by giving any hints or clues."
HPL	But the bank defaulter under cover explained to them that Anacreon was a gay old dog who lived many years ago and wrote about the fun he had when all the world was just like Sheehan's.
HPL	"Both soldiers maintained that we could better afford to antagonise the minority of colonists and civilised natives by inaction, than to antagonise a probable majority of tribesmen and cottagers by stamping out the dread rites."
HPL	"Aunt Martha was in the doorway, and did not scold too hard when Benijah shoved the truant in."
HPL	"It was from this vessel, indeed, that Pope Leo administered the royal unction which made of the hero nomad a Holy Roman Emperor."
HPL	"The rattling continued, growing somewhat louder."
HPL	"We met no one on the road, but presently began to pass deserted farms in varying stages of ruin."
HPL	"All day I forged steadily westward, guided by a far away hummock which rose higher than any other elevation on the rolling desert."
HPL	"If heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon, it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of shelf paper."
HPL	"There were evil smelling staircases which creaked ominously, and on which the old woman seemed to radiate a faint violet light; and finally a door leading off a landing."
HPL	"That sunset was very beautiful, but the peasants at Ballylough had warned me against it and said that Kilderry had become accursed, so that I almost shuddered to see the high turrets of the castle gilded with fire."
HPL	"The fear, however, is an old tradition throughout the neighbouring villages; since it is a prime topic in the simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys to trade hand woven baskets for such primitive necessities as they cannot shoot, raise, or make."
HPL	"West had soon learned that absolute freshness was the prime requisite for useful specimens, and had accordingly resorted to frightful and unnatural expedients in body snatching."
HPL	Unmistakably he was looking at the curtained window and listening shudderingly.
HPL	"But foremost among the weird fancies, and alone in its absolute unanimity, was that of the curse awaiting him who should dare to touch or drain the vast reddish morass."
HPL	"The negro had been knocked out, and a moment's examination shewed us that he would permanently remain so."
HPL	"Sometimes, as a psychological experiment, I would lead him on in these wanderings, and listen to his endless poetical quotations and tales of sunken ships."
HPL	"Late at night the conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan, but all day Sunday Armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college laboratory."
HPL	"I almost saw them, but I knew how to stop."
HPL	"A sudden gust, stronger than the others, caught up the manuscript and bore it toward the window."
HPL	"North of the river there were traces of squalid life active fish packing houses in Water Street, smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there, occasional sounds from indeterminate sources, and infrequent shambling forms in the dismal streets and unpaved lanes but I seemed to find this even more oppressive than the southerly desertion."
HPL	"Inside was a little vestibule with walls from which the plaster was falling, and through the doorway came a faint but peculiarly hateful odour."
HPL	There was no one in the corridor.
HPL	"I shuddered at the thought of those vital processes, worn as they were by eighty one years of continuous functioning, in conflict with unknown forces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid; but in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams, and that these uncomfortable visions could be, at most, no more than my uncle's reaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately filled our minds to the exclusion of all else."
HPL	I had an insistent and unaccountable craving for a sleep whose dreams I should not remember.
HPL	Maybe the Innsmouth folks like 'em to look at themselves Gawd knows they've gotten to be about as bad as South Sea cannibals and Guinea savages.
HPL	"Once in a while it seemed as though we detected a skulking form in the woods nearby, and after a half hour's climb the steepness and narrowness of the way made the advance of so great a body of men over , all told exceedingly cumbrous and difficult."
HPL	"""Nor is it to be thought,"" ran the text as Armitage mentally translated it, ""that man is either the oldest or the last of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone."
HPL	"Certain spots were almost forbidden territory, as he had learned at considerable cost."
HPL	"It was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brush grown railway cut, and when I staggered out to the roadway ahead I saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud."
HPL	"He saw that most of them, in common with their cast off priestcraft, could not escape from the delusion that life has a meaning apart from that which men dream into it; and could not lay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of beauty, even when all Nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries."
HPL	"Through some unprecedented volcanic upheaval, a portion of the ocean floor must have been thrown to the surface, exposing regions which for innumerable millions of years had lain hidden under unfathomable watery depths."
HPL	"About seven o'clock in the evening she had died, and her frantic husband had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill West, whom he wildly blamed for not saving her life."
HPL	It was their changeling and in a spirit of supreme irony Pickman had given the features a very perceptible resemblance to his own.
HPL	"Wisely did Ibn Schacabao say, that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain, and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes."
HPL	"""Some chicken"" leered a drunken man as he viewed the beautiful face, but those who were sober did not leer, looking with respect and abashment at the delicate and spiritual features."
HPL	"Perceptions of the most maddeningly untransmissible sort thronged upon us; perceptions of infinity which at the time convulsed us with joy, yet which are now partly lost to my memory and partly incapable of presentation to others."
HPL	"Sleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of the most disturbing kind."
HPL	"Blue, green, grey, white, or black; smooth, ruffled, or mountainous; that ocean is not silent."
HPL	"Wudn't bother no strangers as might bear tales aoutside that is, withaout they got pryin'."
HPL	"Others, guided by this manuscript if it shall ever be found, must unfold the mysteries at which I can only hint."
HPL	My own sensations can scarcely be recorded.
HPL	"At the bottom of that valley a river once had flowed; for as I examined the scene more closely I beheld the remains of stone and marble bridges and sea walls, and terraces and embankments once verdant and beautiful."
HPL	West did not resist or utter a sound.
HPL	"Then came the frenzied tones again: ""Carter, it's terrible monstrous unbelievable"" This time my voice did not fail me, and I poured into the transmitter a flood of excited questions."
HPL	"""What was it anyhaow, an' haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it aout o' the air it come from?"""
HPL	The alienists soon agreed that abnormal dreams were the foundation of the trouble; dreams whose vividness could for a time completely dominate the waking mind of this basically inferior man.
HPL	"But Barzai was old and learned and had no fears, so led the way boldly up the slope that no man had scaled since the time of Sansu, who is written of with fright in the mouldy Pnakotic Manuscripts."
HPL	"In the later dreams he began to distinguish separate categories into which the organic objects appeared to be divided, and which seemed to involve in each case a radically different species of conduct pattern and basic motivation."
HPL	"I was glad to get out of that bus, and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby."
HPL	The tension on our part became very great.
HPL	"One night he went flying over dark mountains where there were faint, lone campfires at great distances apart, and strange, shaggy herds with tinkling bells on the leaders; and in the wildest part of this hilly country, so remote that few men could ever have seen it, he found a hideously ancient wall or causeway of stone zigzagging along the ridges and valleys; too gigantic ever to have risen by human hands, and of such a length that neither end of it could be seen."
HPL	"Distant though it was from the remnant of a road, the house none the less impressed me unfavourably the very moment I espied it."
HPL	"His oddities certainly did not look Asiatic, Polynesian, Levantine, or negroid, yet I could see why the people found him alien."
HPL	"One of the Marsh daughters was a repellent, reptilian looking woman who wore an excess of weird jewellery clearly of the same exotic tradition as that to which the strange tiara belonged."
HPL	It had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young Wilbur personally.
HPL	"After the entombment we were all somewhat depressed, and spent the afternoon at the bar of the Commercial House; where West, though shaken by the death of his chief opponent, chilled the rest of us with references to his notorious theories."
HPL	"In the dust and shadows of the great attic he found it, remote and forgotten at the back of a drawer in a tall chest."
HPL	"What I saw was an extended and elaborate array of ruined edifices; all of magnificent though unclassified architecture, and in various stages of preservation."
HPL	"Ignorant and dirty, he was at home amongst the other brown skinned Mexicans; having come so I was afterward told from the very lowest sort of surroundings."
HPL	"The trunk had moved intelligently; and, unbelievable to relate, we were both sickeningly sure that articulate sounds had come from the detached head as it lay in a shadowy corner of the laboratory."
HPL	The idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o' prayers an' sech.
HPL	"In the cell with us was one nurse, a mediocre fellow who did not understand the purpose of the apparatus, or think to inquire into my course."
HPL	"Every face but one shewed nobility and reverence, but that one reflected the mockery of the pit."
HPL	"Above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evidently pictorial intent, though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature."
HPL	"Up, up, up the eerie columns slithered, and I saw that all the travellers were converging as they flowed near a sort of focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the centre of the town, where perched a great white church."
HPL	"And for seventeen years after that West would look frequently over his shoulder, and complain of fancied footsteps behind him."
HPL	"Dark wanderers they were, and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year."
HPL	"Shortly after waking on that morning after the storm, I noticed the unaccountable absence of my Hindoo ring from my finger."
HPL	"What I saw unnerved me most surprisingly, considering its relative triviality."
HPL	"This bore regular fruit, for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical sense impacts uninscribable save as gibberish."
HPL	"The more he withdrew from the world about him, the more wonderful became his dreams; and it would have been quite futile to try to describe them on paper."
HPL	"Gross stupidity, falsehood, and muddled thinking are not dream; and form no escape from life to a mind trained above their level."
HPL	"Certainly, Erich Zann was a genius of wild power."
HPL	"March d the crew of the Emma landed on an unknown island and left six men dead; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster's malign pursuit, whilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium And what of this storm of April nd the date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased, and Wilcox emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange fever?"
HPL	"The villagers had shunned the car and the driver from the north, but had whispered to me with pale faces when they saw I was going to Kilderry."
HPL	"She and her brother were not so much interested in the house as was Archer's son Carrington, the present owner, with whom I talked after my experience."
HPL	"It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope."
HPL	Dusk fell and found Birch still toiling.
HPL	Some who knew him do not admit that he ever existed.
HPL	"I've seen sights before, but there was one thing too much here."
HPL	"Now we've only this one thing to fight, and it can't multiply."
HPL	"On the left the floor fell abruptly away, leaving a black triangular gulf out of which, after a second's dry rattling, there presently climbed the hateful little furry thing with the yellow fangs and bearded human face."
HPL	"His interest became a hellish and perverse addiction to the repellently and fiendishly abnormal; he gloated calmly over artificial monstrosities which would make most healthy men drop dead from fright and disgust; he became, behind his pallid intellectuality, a fastidious Baudelaire of physical experiment a languid Elagabalus of the tombs."
HPL	During the interval that Tillinghast was silent I fancied myself in some vast and incredible temple of long dead gods; some vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision.
HPL	"He at no time fully described this object, but occasional frantic words, as repeated by Dr. Tobey, convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his dream sculpture."
HPL	"That night I encamped, and on the following day still travelled toward the hummock, though that object seemed scarcely nearer than when I had first espied it."
HPL	"It was sunny weather, and I was glad of that."
HPL	"On the occasion of the visit, ran the professor's manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host's archaeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the bas relief."
HPL	"But before my fears could crystallise into action I had fallen asleep, and gazed in dreams upon the city in the valley, cold and dead under a shroud of hideous shadow."
HPL	"Three years after the death of Kalos, Musides despatched a messenger to the Tyrant, and it was whispered in the agora at Tegea that the mighty statue was finished."
HPL	Just as they galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came somewhere out of the east and hid all the landscape in its effulgent draperies.
HPL	"One night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion by the vanishment of young Godfrey, son to Henri the Comte."
HPL	The bas relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six inches in area; obviously of modern origin.
HPL	"It was a very foolish hysteria, for the boy had often run away before; but Italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious, and this woman seemed as much harassed by omens as by facts."
HPL	"This was all, together with the picture of the hellish image; but what a train of ideas it started in my mind Here were new treasuries of data on the Cthulhu Cult, and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land."
HPL	"While hatless and dishevelled after my arduous climb, I did not look especially noticeable; and stood a good chance of passing unheeded if forced to encounter any casual wayfarer."
HPL	And her friend Pete Stowacki would not help because he wanted the child out of the way anyhow.
HPL	"For three months Keziah and Brown Jenkin had not been near Joe's room, nor near Paul Choynski's room, nor anywhere else and it meant no good when they held off like that."
HPL	The body must have looked even worse in life but the world holds many ugly things.
HPL	Where did he go sometimes in the night?
HPL	"Armitage, half ready to tell him he might make a copy of what parts he needed, thought suddenly of the possible consequences and checked himself."
HPL	And he said that the young man we had found and tossed overboard was their leader.
HPL	A blackened circle on the floor of the ruined cellar told of a violent stroke from the heavens; and from this spot a group of curious villagers with lanterns were prying a small box of antique workmanship which the thunderbolt had brought to light.
HPL	"After Taran Ish there were many high priests in Sarnath, but never was the sea green stone idol found."
HPL	Meanwhile there grew up about the mansion and the mountain a body of diabolic legendry.
HPL	What mainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls made no sound and set up no echoes.
HPL	"He had had much trouble in discovering the proper formula, for each type of organism was found to need a stimulus especially adapted to it."
HPL	"The wall was high, and all the gates were locked; but moving a pile of boxes in a corner I managed to gain the top and cling to the great stone urn set there."
HPL	"The aspect of the whole was abnormally life like, and the more subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown."
HPL	"I had hoped it would last into the night to help our quest, but a furtive sunbeam from a knothole behind me removed the likelihood of such a thing."
HPL	"Then, close to the hour of midnight, all the bronze gates of Sarnath burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the plain, so that all the visiting princes and travellers fled away in fright."
HPL	"The landlord was in, and greeted him pleasantly."
HPL	An' tell me why Obed was allus droppin' heavy things daown into the deep water t'other side o' the reef whar the bottom shoots daown like a cliff lower'n ye kin saound?
HPL	"When, two days after my frightful crawl through that crypt of the eyes and claw, I learned that a thing had malignly hovered twenty miles away at the same instant the eyes were glaring at me, I experienced virtual convulsions of fright."
HPL	"Accordingly abandoning it as a route, I cautiously moved the bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room."
HPL	"The shutter rattled more loudly, unfastened, and commenced slamming against the window."
HPL	The dreams were meanwhile getting to be atrocious.
HPL	"He now seated me near the machine, so that it was on my right, and turned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs."
HPL	"Family and neighbours had now fled in a panic, and when the more courageous of them returned, Slater was gone, leaving behind an unrecognisable pulp like thing that had been a living man but an hour before."
HPL	"And writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory, despite much familiarity with the papers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this particular species, or even to hint at its remotest affiliations."
HPL	"I had noticed that they were pretty widely distributed around Tempest Mountain, though less numerous on the plain than near the hill top itself, where prehistoric glaciation had doubtless found feebler opposition to its striking and fantastic caprices."
HPL	"The curious manuscript record or diary of Wilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for translation, had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages both ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being absolutely unknown to any available authority."
HPL	"No, he said hastily, as the question was put to him, he did not know the subject of the picture."
HPL	"Ghastly as our prize appeared, it was wholly unresponsive to every solution we injected in its black arm; solutions prepared from experience with white specimens only."
HPL	"I began putting out feelers as we walked along to Water Street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins, but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as I had expected."
HPL	"I was not alone, for foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the grotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests for strange horrors in literature and in life."
HPL	The house was never rented again.
HPL	"I did not like it, and debated whether I had better try to sleep at all."
HPL	"I have said that I dwelt apart from the visible world, but I have not said that I dwelt alone."
HPL	"O' course them as sarved on the Sumatry Queen an' seed the island knowed what he meant, an' wa'n't none too anxious to git clost to sea things like they'd heerd tell on, but them as didn't know what 'twas all abaout got kind o' swayed by what Obed had to say, an' begun to ast him what he cud do to set 'em on the way to the faith as ud bring 'em results."""
HPL	"Then came days of evil, when many who had known The Street of old knew it no more; and many knew it, who had not known it before."
HPL	Only his tendency toward a dazed stupor prevented him from screaming aloud.
HPL	"They had, indeed, come themselves from the stars, and brought Their images with Them."
HPL	"We shall see that at which dogs howl in the dark, and that at which cats prick up their ears after midnight."
HPL	"As I strained to decipher this inscription my notice was distracted by the raucous tones of a cracked bell across the street, and I quickly turned to look out the window on my side of the coach."
HPL	It was by the light of candles that I read I recall the relentless dripping of the wax and there were chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries.
HPL	"Though I knew that death was near, my curiosity was consuming; and I threw the searchlight's beam about in eager quest."
HPL	"He was shocked by his guest's drawn, haggard aspect, and noticed the queer, abnormal looking sunburn which others had remarked during the past week."
HPL	"His fancy had not gone so far as mine, but he felt that the place was rare in its imaginative potentialities, and worthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the grotesque and macabre."
HPL	When Dr. Davis left Birch that night he had taken a lantern and gone to the old receiving tomb.
HPL	"We had previously opened the doors of all the other rooms on that hall, and flung all the windows to the very top."
HPL	"Less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandson a room which several callers saw, though no one was ever admitted to the closely boarded upper story."
HPL	"It being still daylight, I descended to the Square and looked around for a dinner of some sort; noticing as I did so the strange glances I received from the unwholesome loafers."
HPL	"That evening, after a day of hurried cabling and arranging, I bade my host adieu and took a train for San Francisco."
HPL	In Bolton the prevailing spirit of Puritanism had outlawed the sport of boxing with the usual result.
HPL	"Toward morning I must have dropped asleep with the lights on, for I awoke in darkness yesterday afternoon to find the batteries dead."
HPL	"Professor Ellery found platinum, iron, and tellurium in the strange alloy; but mixed with these were at least three other apparent elements of high atomic weight which chemistry was absolutely powerless to classify."
HPL	"Presently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family resemblance in his face, but I only shuddered, because I was sure that the face was merely a devilish waxen mask."
HPL	"The admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning tomorrow, at which every effort will be made to induce Johansen to speak more freely than he has done hitherto."
HPL	"Knowing that the Thing could surely overtake the Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the engine for full speed, ran lightning like on deck and reversed the wheel."
HPL	"Fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd, for they did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up; and they were grateful when West, in spite of my involuntary shudders, offered to get rid of the thing quietly for a purpose I knew too well."
HPL	"As he bathed and changed clothes he tried to recall what he had dreamed after the scene in the violet litten space, but nothing definite would crystallise in his mind."
HPL	"Glass or no glass, I must explore it a little."
HPL	D'ye want to skeer yer Aunt Marthy plumb to death?
HPL	It is sufficient for me to relate events without analysing causes.
HPL	"The bus, rather early, rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight, and an evil looking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver."
HPL	"Oral accounts of the mysterious and secluded wife had been numerous, but no tangible relic of her stay at Jermyn House remained."
HPL	"He tottered, clutched at the curtains as I had done before, and wriggled his head wildly, like a hunted animal."
HPL	"I tried to raise my hand to shut out the sight, yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could not fully obey my will."
HPL	He always causes that.
HPL	"Suddenly a great chasm opened before him, ten feet deep, so that he had to let himself down by his hands and drop to a slanting floor, and then crawl perilously up a natural defile in the opposite wall."
HPL	"That morning and afternoon I wandered alone through the sun gilded village and talked now and then with idle labourers, for Barry was busy with the final plans for beginning his work of drainage."
HPL	All this research work required a prodigious supply of freshly slaughtered human flesh and that was why Herbert West had entered the Great War.
HPL	Go thou then to Athok the cobbler or be gone out of the city by sunset.
HPL	"An' they's awful kinder marks in the yard, tew great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead, an' all sticky with stuff like is on the blowed up haouse."
HPL	"He see enough, I tell ye, Mis' Corey This dun't mean no good, an' I think as all the men folks ought to git up a party an' do suthin'."
HPL	"No one remains to lay flowers before the granite portal, and few care to brave the depressing shadows which seem to linger strangely about the water worn stones."
HPL	"He believed that his great secret knowledge of gods could shield him from their wrath, so resolved to go up to the summit of high and rocky Hatheg Kla on a night when he knew the gods would be there."
HPL	You'll never know what the world has escaped.
HPL	"Near the hut, close to a rather unusual rock fissure, had lain two skeletons, newly picked by vultures, and presumably forming the sole remains of his parents."
HPL	"Perhaps it was his mountain freedom that he missed, or perhaps the turmoil in his brain had grown too acute for his rather sluggish physique; but at all events the flame of vitality flickered low in the decadent body."
HPL	He wasn't strictly human.
HPL	"The general fact is, that the house was never regarded by the solid part of the community as in any real sense ""haunted""."
HPL	"Elwood would, if awake, rouse him whenever he began to talk or rise in his sleep."
HPL	"He tried to recall just where he had found the key, but something seemed very confused."
HPL	"As the old man whispered the words ""more the same"" a tiny spattering impact was heard, and something shewed on the yellowed paper of the upturned volume."
HPL	"What would happen on reanimation, and whether we could hope for a revival of mind and reason, West did not venture to predict."
HPL	"This time he resolved to reply in kind, and his own hands reached out for the creature's throat."
HPL	"And the bird of heaven flew before, and led us toward the basalt pillars of the West, but this time the oarsmen sang no soft songs under the full moon."
HPL	"The Fish Street bridge, according to the sketch, was in ruins."
HPL	"I had intended to pass by the remains of the stranger with averted face, but as I approached the body, I seemed to hear emanating from it a faint sound, as though life were not yet wholly extinct."
HPL	"The shell had been merciful, in a way but West could never feel as certain as he wished, that we two were the only survivors."
HPL	"Here we were comparatively calm, despite a somewhat puzzling southward current which we could not identify from our oceanographic charts."
HPL	"""Do you know what that is?"" he whispered."
HPL	"There were, it is true, exceptions; indeed, the horror which had caught the world's ear had happened in a treeless space remote alike from the mansion and from any connecting woods."
HPL	"I would sometimes rise very quietly in the night, stealing out to walk in those churchyards and places of burial from which I had been kept by my parents."
HPL	Have you no brain whereby you may recognise the will which has through six long centuries fulfilled the dreadful curse upon your house?
HPL	"Obviously, the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a battering ram."
HPL	"I have said that I am a constant speculator concerning dream life, and from this you may judge of the eagerness with which I applied myself to the study of the new patient as soon as I had fully ascertained the facts of his case."
HPL	Did they have dogs after all?
HPL	"But the fact remained that on a summer night a bolt had come out of the heavens and left a dead village whose corpses were horribly mangled, chewed, and clawed."
HPL	"He merely pointed to a book of prodigious size which lay open on the table, while the beldame thrust a huge grey quill into Gilman's right hand."
HPL	"Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child; concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might and did speculate as widely as they chose."
HPL	"Of ghastly marble were its walls and its towers, its columns, domes, and pavements."
HPL	"The room became pandemonium, and men screamed and howled in fright at the sinister being they had aroused."
HPL	"This work was not known to the fashionable clientele who had so swiftly built up his fame after his arrival in Boston; but was only too well known to me, who had been his closest friend and sole assistant since the old days in Miskatonic University Medical School at Arkham."
HPL	"Beings must have cared for my needs, yet I cannot recall any person except myself; or anything alive but the noiseless rats and bats and spiders."
HPL	"He seemed exceptionally eager to talk, and I soon gathered that he did not like the place, its fishy smell, or its furtive people."
HPL	"As I considered the inevitable end my mind ran over preceding events, and developed a hitherto dormant impression which would have caused a weaker and more superstitious man to shudder."
HPL	Soon afterward Earl Sawyer told the loungers at Osborn's that more carpentry was going on in the Whateley farmhouse.
HPL	"For some time, apparently, the curious angles of Gilman's room had been having a strange, almost hypnotic effect on him; and as the bleak winter advanced he had found himself staring more and more intently at the corner where the down slanting ceiling met the inward slanting wall."
HPL	Yew grows an' that grows faster.
HPL	"At three o'clock he took some lunch at a restaurant, noting meanwhile that the pull had either lessened or divided itself."
HPL	"Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men, and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces."
HPL	"Yog Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet."
HPL	"Grotesque beyond the imagination of a or a Bulwer, they were damnably human in general outline despite webbed hands and feet, shockingly wide and flabby lips, glassy, bulging eyes, and other features less pleasant to recall."
HPL	"Then there rang out a scream from a wholly different throat such a scream as roused half the sleepers of Arkham and haunted their dreams ever afterward such a scream as could come from no being born of earth, or wholly of earth."
HPL	"Nor did the spirit change when they tore open the earth to lay down strange pipes, or when they set up tall posts bearing weird wires."
HPL	"We had at last what West had always longed for a real dead man of the ideal kind, ready for the solution as prepared according to the most careful calculations and theories for human use."
HPL	"People generally suspected him of knowing something about his mother's disappearance, and very few ever approached his neighbourhood now."
HPL	What motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the Emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol?
HPL	I saw him on a sleepless night when I was walking desperately to save my soul and my vision.
HPL	Neither he nor his son Archer knew of the shunned house as other than a nuisance almost impossible to rent perhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odour of unkempt old age.
HPL	"He could, he was sure, get out by midnight though it is characteristic of him that this thought was untinged with eerie implications."
HPL	"Industry did not flourish here, and the nineteenth century factory movement proved short lived."
HPL	"Generation after generation lived and felt and died there, and in days when people weren't afraid to live and feel and die."
HPL	"He was, in all his gradations of morbidity between the frankly non human and the degradedly human, establishing a sardonic linkage and evolution."
HPL	"Again he seemed to be in the interior of a house an old house, apparently but the details and inhabitants were constantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed in just as great a state of flux as the more presumably mobile objects."
HPL	"The man paused, and another of the crowd spoke."
HPL	"Twelve years after succeeding to his title he married the daughter of his gamekeeper, a person said to be of gypsy extraction, but before his son was born joined the navy as a common sailor, completing the general disgust which his habits and mesalliance had begun."
HPL	Gradually a calming of the wind and dispersal of the unusual darkness told of the storm's passing.
HPL	"I could not sleep Saturday night, and turned on the lights regardless of the future."
HPL	Better stay over here and take the ten o'clock bus tomorrow morning; then you can get an evening bus there for Arkham at eight o'clock.
HPL	From the revolver I knew that he was thinking more of the crazed Italian than of the police.
HPL	"I was lying with my back to the east window overlooking the bog, where the waning moon would rise, and therefore expected to see light cast on the opposite wall before me; but I had not looked for such a sight as now appeared."
HPL	"As I swung the beam around to the south, I noticed that the ocean floor ahead fell away in a marked declivity, and bore curiously regular blocks of stone in certain places, disposed as if in accordance with definite patterns."
HPL	"Apparently this acidulous matron was right; for about a.m. the whole house was aroused by cries coming from West's room, where when they broke down the door they found the two of us unconscious on the blood stained carpet, beaten, scratched, and mauled, and with the broken remnants of West's bottles and instruments around us."
HPL	"The damn' government can try tuh make folks good ef it wants tuh, but it can't stop a feller from hittin' 'er up when he feels like it."
HPL	"I had drilled myself in preparation for the crucial moment, and blind training saved me."
HPL	"The widowed Rhoby Harris never recovered from the shock of her husband's death, and the passing of her first born Elkanah two years later was the final blow to her reason."
HPL	Nor was any child to be born alive in that house for a century and a half.
HPL	"He told 'em he'd knowed of folks as prayed to gods that give somethin' ye reely need, an' says ef a good bunch o' men ud stand by him, he cud mebbe git a holt o' sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o' fish an' quite a bit o' gold."
HPL	Of these categories one seemed to him to include objects slightly less illogical and irrelevant in their motions than the members of the other categories.
HPL	"And the mists of the dawn are thicker, and sailors are not quite so sure that all the muffled seaward ringing is that of the solemn buoys."
HPL	"The town was getting more and more on my nerves, and I looked behind me furtively as I picked my way back over the tottering Water Street bridge."
HPL	"I know not why my dreams were so wild that night; but ere the waning and fantastically gibbous moon had risen far above the eastern plain, I was awake in a cold perspiration, determined to sleep no more."
HPL	"I hear and do strange things in sleep, and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror."
HPL	"All were pointing to a certain passage, and every face seemed so distorted with epileptic and reverberant laughter that I almost thought I heard the fiendish echoes."
HPL	"I stopped automatically, though lacking the brain to retreat."
HPL	"His ears were ringing horribly, as if with the residual echoes of some horrible noise heard in dreams."
HPL	Finally I summoned up courage and propped the small object up on the table against a book then turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon it.
HPL	"In , under the benign rule of the Ostrogoth Theodoric, we behold him as a teacher of rhetoric at Rome, and in he held the consulship together with Pompilius Numantius Bombastes Marcellinus Deodamnatus."
HPL	"Once a gap in the trees opened up to the right, so that he saw off across leagues of twilight meadow and spied the old Congregational steeple on Central Hill in Kingsport; pink with the last flush of day, the panes of the little round windows blazing with reflected fire."
HPL	"And the houses of the cities of Cathuria are all palaces, each built over a fragrant canal bearing the waters of the sacred Narg."
HPL	"On his throat were the marks of murderous hands, and on his left ankle was a distressing rat bite."
HPL	"That evening I regretted that I had not taken the ivory image surreptitiously from poor Klenze's pocket as he left, for the memory of it fascinated me."
HPL	"I took a seat far behind him, but on the same side of the bus, since I wished to watch the shore during the journey."
HPL	"There was talk of a complaint to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but nothing ever came of it, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world's attention to themselves."
HPL	"For several days they glided undulatingly over the water, till finally they came to the horizon, where the sea meets the sky."
HPL	"An indefinite dampness seemed upon the place, and I marvelled that no fire should be blazing."
HPL	"The skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of long greenish grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply."
HPL	"The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens."
HPL	"From what black wells of Acherontic fear or feeling, from what unplumbed gulfs of extra cosmic consciousness or obscure, long latent heredity, were those half articulate thunder croakings drawn?"
HPL	"Dolphins still encircled the U , a somewhat remarkable circumstance considering the distance we had covered."
HPL	It was Rodriguez the Portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what he had found.
HPL	"Up the long drive rolled the coaches of the Boston gentry, whilst on foot came a numerous assemblage of powdered exquisites from the neighbouring mansions."
HPL	"Such was our frame of mind as we talked far into the night, till my uncle's growing drowsiness made me remind him to lie down for his two hour sleep."
HPL	"Not from each other did Kalos and Musides conceal their work, but the sight was for them alone."
HPL	Then it was obvious that the pursuers were gaining.
HPL	"And then, as the breach became large enough, they came out into the laboratory in single file; led by a stalking thing with a beautiful head made of wax."
HPL	"After a time he became noticeably unbalanced, gazing for hours at his ivory image and weaving fanciful stories of the lost and forgotten things under the sea."
HPL	"And it was very odd that shingles so worm eaten could survive, or bricks so crumbled still form a standing chimney."
HPL	"Again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door, and again a receding creaking."
HPL	"Of this sad change he seemed by no means unaware, and little by little his expression and conversation both took on a gruesome irony which restored in me something of the subtle repulsion I had originally felt."
HPL	Why the third degree?
HPL	"Folks see his three darters a wearin' gold like things as nobody'd never see on 'em afore, an' smoke started comin' aout o' the refin'ry chimbly."
HPL	"Trever, now thoroughly terrified and cured forever of his desire to see life via the vice route, edged closer to the blue coated newcomers."
HPL	"He was hideously sure that in unrecalled dreams he had talked with both Brown Jenkin and the old woman, and that they had been urging him to go somewhere with them and to meet a third being of greater potency."
HPL	"The frigidity of the apartment was now sensibly diminishing, and at about a.m. the doctor retired to the bathroom, commanding me to keep him supplied with all the ice I could obtain at all night drug stores and cafeterias."
HPL	"The labourers were not as happy as they might have been, for most of them seemed uneasy over some dream which they had had, yet which they tried in vain to remember."
HPL	"Through my terror ran curious reminiscences of Paradise Lost, and of Satan's hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of darkness."
HPL	"Brown Jenkin, too, was always a little nearer at the last, and its yellowish white fangs glistened shockingly in that unearthly violet phosphorescence."
HPL	"Its rowers, though distantly and indistinctly seen, were of an especially repellent aspect."
HPL	Death was indeed there.
HPL	"Mounting a chair, he attached one end of the rope to a hook in the great exposed central beam of black oak, and began making a noose with the other end."
HPL	"I went directly home to Toledo from Boston, and later spent a month at Maumee recuperating from my ordeal."
HPL	"There was something there and now I can't use the subway or and you may as well have your laugh at this, too go down into cellars any more."
HPL	"Something like fear chilled me as I sat there in the small hours alone I say alone, for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone; perhaps more alone than he can realise."
HPL	My mother and uncle Walter had not looked like that.
HPL	"It is palpably a part of the valley wall, though how the vast interior was ever excavated I cannot imagine."
HPL	"Years of the Titans were recalled, but the host grew timid when he spoke of the dim first age of chaos before the gods or even the Elder Ones were born, and when only the other gods came to dance on the peak of Hatheg Kla in the stony desert near Ulthar, beyond the river Skai."
HPL	"Ye toil to live, but is not life made of beauty and song?"
HPL	"The shrieking, roaring confusion of sound which permeated the abysses was past all analysis as to pitch, timbre, or rhythm; but seemed to be synchronous with vague visual changes in all the indefinite objects, organic and inorganic alike."
HPL	"For some time he rambled on with an almost feverish geniality, when it struck me to ask him how he came by so rare a book as Pigafetta's Regnum Congo."
HPL	"Yet when the men of Ulthar and Nir and Hatheg crushed their fears and scaled that haunted steep by day in search of Barzai the Wise, they found graven in the naked stone of the summit a curious and Cyclopean symbol fifty cubits wide, as if the rock had been riven by some titanic chisel."
HPL	"But when I went to Sinara I found the dromedary men all drunken and ribald, and saw that their songs were not as mine, so I travelled in a barge down the Xari to onyx walled Jaren."
HPL	"After he had secured my reluctant acquiescence in his design, Warren picked up the reel of wire and adjusted the instruments."
HPL	"There the scions of a conquering race indeed flourished free from the restrictions of their fellows, but cowered in an appalling slavery to the dismal phantasms of their own minds."
HPL	"Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon."
HPL	"And the children grew up comfortably, and more families came from the Mother Land to dwell on The Street."
HPL	"Our compasses, depth gauges, and other delicate instruments were ruined; so that henceforth our only reckoning would be guesswork, based on our watches, the calendar, and our apparent drift as judged by any objects we might spy through the portholes or from the conning tower."
HPL	"He would babble of current topics, revealing a wide acquaintance with newspapers and a great tendency to philosophise in a sententious village fashion."
HPL	"He was wholly alone, and his first act was to walk to the balustrade and look dizzily down at the endless, Cyclopean city almost two thousand feet below."
HPL	"This impression was confirmed by my uncle's less systematic array of miscellaneous data legends transcribed from servant gossip, cuttings from the papers, copies of death certificates by fellow physicians, and the like."
HPL	"It was frightful beyond conception; toward the last, when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickered close to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease was spreading, it seemed as though the shifting features fought against themselves, and strove to form contours like those of my uncle's kindly face."
HPL	I've seen Wilbur Whateley's diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read; and I think I know the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away.
HPL	"But still there remained that burning determination to reach the innermost secret of the fear, which I had once more come to deem definite, material, and organic."
HPL	"It was one thing to chase the nameless entity, but quite another to find it."
HPL	"Just as the building was wiped out by a German shell, there had been a success."
HPL	"Here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness, those farthest south seeming the most decayed."
HPL	"All the servants were asleep in the attic, so I answered the bell."
HPL	"My uncle looked concerned, and paused in his unwrapping to study my countenance."
HPL	"This marked the beginning of a course of cattle buying on the part of small Wilbur's family which ended only in , when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did the ramshackle Whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock."
HPL	"Perhaps the ornaments had, after all, come from some strange island; and possibly the wild stories were lies of the bygone Obed himself rather than of this antique toper."
HPL	"I hate those Innsmouth folks myself, and I wouldn't care to go to their town."
HPL	"And so far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting."
HPL	"Dr. Whipple was a sane, conservative physician of the old school, and for all his interest in the place was not eager to encourage young thoughts toward the abnormal."
HPL	"On a pair of golden crouching lions rested the throne, many steps above the gleaming floor."
HPL	"Simple animals they were, gently descending the evolutionary scale because of their unfortunate ancestry and stultifying isolation."
HPL	"He gave old Matt the very best his skill could produce, but was thrifty enough to save the rejected specimen, and to use it when Asaph Sawyer died of a malignant fever."
HPL	"Reticence such as this is seldom without a cause, nor indeed was ours; for our requirements were those resulting from a life work distinctly unpopular."
HPL	I think I had a family then though the details are very uncertain and I know there were many servants.
HPL	"And because mere walls and windows must soon drive to madness a man who dreams and reads much, the dweller in that room used night after night to lean out and peer aloft to glimpse some fragment of things beyond the waking world and the greyness of tall cities."
HPL	"That those venturesome youths will come back they do not doubt, but they think a light may be gone from their eyes, and a will from their hearts."
HPL	Then he said we were the victims of a vicious bull though the animal was a difficult thing to place and account for.
HPL	"I didn't keep track of the cross streets, and can't tell you yet which it was we turned up, but I know it wasn't Greenough Lane."
HPL	"It was called, she said, ""The Esoteric Order of Dagon"", and was undoubtedly a debased, quasi pagan thing imported from the East a century before, at a time when the Innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren."
HPL	"And overhead, scarce ten degrees from the zenith, glowed that watching Pole Star."
HPL	"""I hope you won't stay till after dark."
HPL	"The worst thing for a while was keeping Joe Mazurewicz quiet; for the brooding loomfixer would never stay sober, and was constantly whining and muttering about spectral and terrible things."
HPL	"These persons were not all cut off suddenly by any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiously sapped, so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency to weakness he may have naturally had."
HPL	"Then came out of the earth the black spirits of earth, mouldy and shadowy, and full of dim rumours picked up in caverns beneath forgotten sea bottoms."
HPL	"He was getting an intuitive knack for solving Riemannian equations, and astonished Professor Upham by his comprehension of fourth dimensional and other problems which had floored all the rest of the class."
HPL	"But I disliked it when I fancied I heard the closing of one of the windows that the settle faced, as if it had been stealthily opened."
HPL	"Then, long after both he and Gilman had retired, the atrocious shrieking began."
HPL	"In time the hole grew so large that he ventured to try his body in it now and then, shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and creaked."
HPL	"As I watched choked by a sudden rise in the fishy odour after a short abatement I saw a band of uncouth, crouching shapes loping and shambling in the same direction; and knew that this must be the party guarding the Ipswich road, since that highway forms an extension of Eliot Street."
HPL	"This person was the late William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology in Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note."
HPL	"And dogs barked as the yellow light of small paned windows shone out at the farther turn, and the Pleiades twinkled across the open knoll where a great gambrel roof stood black against the dim west."
HPL	"In Auckland I learned that Johansen had returned with yellow hair turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at Sydney, and had thereafter sold his cottage in West Street and sailed with his wife to his old home in Oslo."
HPL	"The present voodoo orgy was, indeed, on the merest fringe of this abhorred area, but that location was bad enough; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and incidents."
HPL	"In all these streets no living thing was visible, and I wondered at the complete absense of cats and dogs from Innsmouth."
HPL	"My grandfather and his widowed son Walter now comprised the Cleveland household, but the memory of older times hung thickly over it."
HPL	"There were reasons why I would have been glad to let the war separate us; reasons why I found the practice of medicine and the companionship of West more and more irritating; but when he had gone to Ottawa and through a colleague's influence secured a medical commission as Major, I could not resist the imperious persuasion of one determined that I should accompany him in my usual capacity."
HPL	"Once we fancied that a large, opaque body darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it, and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off."
