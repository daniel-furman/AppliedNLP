The methods above all identify *any* mentions of a WordNet synset in a text  -- e.g., every instance of *bank* would be identified as a hit for query bank.n.01 (\"sloping land ...\"), even if its specific word sense in context was the financial institution (or even a verb).  How might we improve on this method?"

Therefore, if we only took synonyms, we would only get the instance we are interested in. We could potentially accomplish this by finding the Cosine similarity betweeen BERT embeddings, and by setting some threshold similarity to determine if the two words are synonyms or not. "
